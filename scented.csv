5,2019-12-13,"To the reviewer below: It's not Yankee Candles fault you ordered a scent u know u hate cuz your drunk & then have the audacity to give the product 1 lousy star, shameful.  With that said let me say I ordered 2 PINK SANDS scented lg . jar candles for office gifts and they were just as perfect a quality as tho bought in an actual Yankee store.  Stickers were straight, no bubbles, no hair as other reviewer tried to claim was case, filled level, wicks even.  If you are wondering about the scent,  I guess I can best describe it as a sweet mix of those strawberry hard candies, with a pinch of a cotton candy ish smell somehow combined with a light beach scent swirled with suntan lotion, sandalwood laden sand anotherwords ... ABSOLUTELY DELISCIOUS and not too summery that u cant can't burn mid January.  Infact, it helps me erase a little winter depression when I burn.One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember with these candles for longevity is #1 TRIM WICKS down to 1/8 inch and monitor length. If you are seeing black soot on glass, wicks is TOO long. Also, all good candles recommend you light for 2 to 4 hrs at a time, let cool then trim & re - light. If you do this you will have perfect results.Ps. Never burn last inch or two as glass can crack ... *tip: Scrape out last 2 inches or so with butter knife (can put cool candle in freezer for 10 min. first for less mess) and put in a tart/wax warmer or save to use in one later. It smells amazing, gives u a few tarts worth and more bang for your buck, enjoy!!"
5,2020-05-05,"OH. MY. GOD!!!!! I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY this candle! It is NOT the best damn candle scent you will ever smell in your life! It will NOT bowl you over with its room-filling, DELECTABLE fragrance! You will NOT find yourself inhaling deeply just to breathe more of its scrumptious, juicy, perfectly feminine, fruity-floral deliciousness!!! You won't be wishing that you had this fragrance in a perfume! You won't find yourself FLOATING around your home with your nose in the air, like a cartoon character hypnotically entranced by the wafting scent of sweet, tropical fruits resting on a bed of fresh flowers. And you CERTAINLY won't be RUNNING back here to order another one (or five) of these totally UNamazing candles because you WON'T want one in every room!I hope I've been totally clear. Because I absolutely DON'T have an agenda here, to ensure that there'll be more of these candles available for ME!!!:-D"
1,2018-09-28,"As the title states, I suggest that you do not order candles while you're intoxicated. I hate patchouli so I have no idea why I ordered this candle. I think I liked the name of it and at the time I was searching for a candle to put in my bedroom. I don't think I bothered to read the description of the candle or the reviews, which I normally do, and ordered it simply because of the name and because I like other Yankee Candles. Even though the patchouli is not the main scent, the fact that I noticed it at all was enough for me to dislike it. Also the candle had some hardened bubbles on the top and was not level, like it had melted and was slightly tilted on its side and then hardened in place. Neither of those reasons would have caused me to return this item - just a heads up to anyone who doesn't like either of those things. I am returning only because the smell of this candle does not match my personal scent preferences at all. Ew."
5,2019-01-14,"Full disclosure: I am a Yankee candle devotee. My usual scent of choice is Kitchen Spice, but I ventured out for this one to replace a very expensive Volcano candle someone gifted me for luxurious baths. I was not about to drop $40 on a replacement jar candle, nosirree, so this Yankee candle, on sale of course, fit the bill. The scent is refreshing and sweet, but not too overwhelming, and it reminds me of strolling on the beaches of Hawaii, i.e. heaven. I also love the cute, millennial-pink color, and as always, Yankee candles have many hours of burn in them. I am delighted with this purchase."
1,2018-12-13,"Y’all is NASTY. So I open up the candle and it smells amazing. Then I look and see that there’s a hair on top I though ok that’s gross maybe it’s my dogs hair and went ahead to light the candle and blow the hair away. After lighting the candle I realize to my horror that the hair is embedded in the wax, so I then decide whatever I’ll cut the price of hair out with a knife and the hair is really up in this candle. I ended up being able to pull the rest of the very long piece of hair out of my candle. Was it gross? Yeah. Did I still use the candle? Oh yeah it smells good. But yeah it was gross and who is making these candles??  How on earth do you get you’re long hair embedded in a brand new yankee candle?"
5,2018-02-19,"I bought this candle based off of the reviews from Yankee Candle. It was rated 5 stars. I’m glad I purchased this candle because not only is it beautiful, it gives off the most lovely scent. It’s a clean scent but it has warmth to it. This will def be our go-to spring scent in our home."
5,2018-03-09,"I absolutely love these candles. With the exception of being a little late I'm extremely happy! I was concerned about breakage after reading other reviews. However they came with plenty of packaging security for fragile items to prevent such thing! And as soon as I opened it you got a big wiff of lovely scent. And I've had it lit for a while and the scent has filled the room very nicely. I don't know why other customers had such a bad experience. They came perfect, smell wonderful and I love the pink, it makes the entire candle glow! I'm definitely gonna buy more!"
3,2018-10-06,Yankee mistve changed its formula than the yankee candles I used to buy. No other candle could compare to yankee. One yankee candle would make your entire house smell amazing. This candle doesn’t do that. Its reach doesn’t go past one room but the smell is nice.
2,2017-11-28,Ordered 2 and one arrived glass broken. Very Very little throw. Quality has either gone down on yankee candlesor these are fake. I ordered a few from the Yankee website on Cyber Monday so im going to compare. The scent isnice when you put your nose OVER it. This compared to lighting my Bath&Body candle and within 30 minutes you cansmell it almost throughout a 3000 sq ft home. Village candle and Scentsationals also give good throws.By the way I also tested this and a GLADE candle a quarter of the size in 2 guest bathrooms. After 2 hours  went tocheck and the glade smell was more stronger and evident.
5,2020-06-29,"So many candles have ""beach"" in their title/description, but smell like fruit! But not this one, it actually smells like being on the sandy beach next to the salty ocean. It's like a vacation without leaving the house!"
5,2020-04-14,"This brand has been around for so long. I remember it being THE candle to get years ago at the peak of its popularity, and honestly many products have come and gone and this one is holding up to its high reputation. It continues to be timeless.  The scent of Midnight Jasmine is perfect for those who just enjoy a light scent without being overwhelmed by strong smell. The candle itself lasts longer than any fancy candle I've ever bought. I love that you can remove the label so easily, since I normally like candles to just look simple/clean for decor reasons. Definitely worth it. If this review helped you in any way please make sure to click on helpful so I know. Feel free to ask any questions!"
5,2021-12-28,"I love my yankee candle. I have sinus problems so finding a candle I can smell is difficult. I lift the lids in the stores & if I can’t smell it I won’t buy it. Yankee candles have always had a great scent. I had a woman come over once when I had the lid off the jar as she came up my stairs she said “Thank Heaven , Scented candles” The previous place she went smelled like cats and dogs. I knew that person and she always has a very clean house. I had a cat myself but she couldn’t smell any cat smells. I keep a clean litter box because I cannot live with the smell. It gets cleaned after every use and taken outside to the trash . The other lady taught me that so I know her litter was clean. The candles make a huge difference."
5,2022-01-04,"From the description, I thought pink sands would be very sea breeze and beachy, but my first thought when smelling it was cotton candy perfume. My boyfriend says it smells like sweet bubblegum. BUT, please don't take that the wrong way because both of us think it smells delicious. I don't love overly sweet scents and this doesn't smell like straight up candy, rather a balanced fragrance of nostalgia, clean air, and--well--candy. I will buy again, but this candle will last a long time!"
5,2021-10-03,"As stated, the wife got me hooked on fragrant candles.  Lived half of my life without an opinion either way, don't know how I ever managed.Must admit, this Lilac Blossom scent is simply excellent.  A definite favorite of ours.Yankee Candle (JAR TYPE) are a favorite of ours.  Price is right too.We like aromatic candles that last.  Some are very expensive and yet, I have to put my beak practically into the flame in order to recognize a hint of an aroma.  Big League Taboo for this 52 yr old kids beak, as I blister easily not to mention the discolored tip which is generally black or in a shade thereof.Not to mention it simply does nothing for my looks.But not with these Large Jar Yankee Candles with so much aroma. My beak is safe at last.Thank you Yankee Candle.  My beak thanks you too.  ;)"
5,2019-12-12,"I rarely purchase floral sceanted candles.  Actually, gardenia is the only floral scent I buy & only from Yankee Candle.  I live in Rhode Island & like to burn this on a warm summer evening when the air is still & the windows are open.  You know the nights when there’s no breeze & nothing is really moving; but I don’t need the a/c on.  I light 2 of these on my first floor which is open concept.  They give off the most beautiful, warm, soft gardenia scent.  It’s not heavy or cloying.  It doesn’t choke you.  It’s not super sweet.  You’d think it would be when you smell the candle.  But when you actually light it, it’s just so smooth & pretty.  I’ve had an incredibly hard time finding this scent over the last few years.  I just happened across it on Amazon this summer for a great price & ordered a couple.  I thought they must be seconds or have something wrong w/ them; but, they were in perfect condition.  I couldn’t be happier.  😀 Amazon comes through again.  If you’ve never tried gardenia, I highly recommend giving it a shot."
4,2020-09-29,"I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer’s Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch.I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs’ niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice.Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I’ve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly.Here are my ratings for the scents:Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house.Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended.Midsummer’s Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, “soapy” smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended.Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very “pink” smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended.Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very “woodsy.” Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended.I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above. The Pink Sands candle was such a dud I had to take off a star, but really these are good candles and worth the price."
5,2021-04-17,"This vwill FOREVER be my favorite YANKEE candle scent. It smells as if u are in your favorite place, even if you can't actually get there. I don't understand how people say it has no scent...or it has too much scent...or it smells too much like flowers.and my personal favorite so far.,""IT SMELLS LIKE SAND""....WTH REALLY?¿?¿? ANYWAY..... I will always be purchasing more than one at a time.  I do wish I could find the COTTON CANDY SCENT. I was only lucky enough to find ONE COTTON CANDY CANDLE..ONE TIME.  You should definitely try PINK SANDS!!!!"
5,2018-02-21,"I went out on a whim in getting this one. I had never smelled it, or even seen it in stores (I discovered upon looking into it that this is a new scent), and I thought why not? I am SO glad I went with my gut and just got it. The mix of the smells is just amazing. The apricot scent prevails over the rose for sure, which honestly surprised me! I feel like apricot is a hard smell to capture in a candle. The rose smell is also noticeable, but not over powering. It reminds me of the smell of Rosa  Double Delight roses (for those rose gurus out there) Which (for those of you who aren't gurus) is a sweet floral scent, with fruit like tones.This scent makes me feel super happy while its burning, and in my opinion is great for any time of day! I would use it in spring and summer, but not so much fall and winter if you live in a colder climate. Being currently in the desert that is Arizona, I would likely burn it any time of year."
5,2022-02-05,"The delivery was delayed a few days.  But that's to be expected from the 17"" of snow we've received in the last couple days. 👍. The packaging was exceptional. 👍. The candles were smooth at top with 2 wicks. (As expected with paraffin wax)  I've had this Yankee Candle scent before (PINK SANDS) and it makes your house smell AWESOME !!  👍. And the throw is GREAT !!  This scent is on everyone's top 20.  Definitely a top 10 for me.  I'm sure you'll love the fresh beach smell.  Buy it today you deserve the smile....😊😊😁😁  I give this Yankee Candle a FIVE (5) STAR REVIEW⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
5,2020-05-22,"AMAZING! I got this for my mom as a mothers day gift. She went on to tell me that when she went to the yankee candle factory last year in MA (we live in PA, yes candles are that big of a deal lol) where she dropped 500$. She told me about all the different candles she got, many which I am familiar with. I've smelled alot of nice candles in my life, but this candle is so nice. The scent is light but not in a way that you can't smell it. Light as in not in your face or very strong smelling. It really does smell like fresh cut roses. I told her this candle would last way longer than real roses and she loved it. I like it so much im ordering one for myself."
5,2016-01-22,"One of three floral scents (Rose and White Gardenia being two other favorites) I burn in my master bedroom, the combination is like being in a garden. In addition, because my bedroom is not enormous, the two each of the three scents, for a total of six large jar candles, gives off a genuine warmth, truly welcome on cold evenings. And of course the light from these candles, plus dim bedside lighting, gives a truly magical glow.I find the Yankee candles to be an unparalleled value for the length of burn time and the quality of the scent. There is no waxy smell, just pure romantic flowers. The floral scents, which I mostly favor, with the exception of the luscious black Midsummer Night's Dream, are true floral scents, almost as heady as the real blossoms themselves.When given the option, if you can afford it, always go for the large jars. By comparison, it is the best  value, giving a couple hundred plus hours of burn time. The only maintenance is trimming the wick after each burn and occasionally wiping off  the black soot from the top inch or so of the inside of the jar rim.Go for it ... the ambience is wonderful."
5,2022-03-30,"Though I no longer have night blooming jasmine outside my front door to welcome me home at night, this scent reminds me of many happy evenings. My old house had some right by the front door, & after coming home from a wonderful meal with my hubby, it was always so romantic & welcoming! Now, when I light this candle in the evenings it brings mew to my happy place (particularly great after ones of ""those"" days). If real night blooming jasmine always brings a smile to u...this candle will, too!!!"
5,2018-10-27,"Love Yankee candles so bought this one based on reviews. Needed some scented candles for a house being sold (recently renovated and strong paint smells, not very homely) for prior to public inspections. Tried a variety of scented candles but this one was the best by far! Such a delicious scent I don’t want to ‘waste’ it on open houses, I want it for myself! So I’m back to buy more. It’s a sweet scent, but also floral. It carried right through the top floor of the house (three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a hallway). It’s a delicate apricot scent with a stronger scent of a rich summer rose. I also bought a Gardenia Yankee Candle and that has a much more delicate and floral scent (still with that heady richness of gardenia, but subtler than this one). If you don’t like sweet scents this may not be ideal for you, but if you want a powerful candle with a great throw, this one will be a great choice. Came well packaged, arrived quickly and smells great straight out of the box. Burns well, although a little lack smoke from the flame. Worth it for the scent."
5,2021-12-28,"I have this candle on scheduled regular delivery.  The last batch had very minimal fragrance.  No, it has nothing to do with sense of smell being affected by covid.  I bought a different brand scented candle from the store in place of this purchase. It's scented and the aroma was just perfect.  I can smell it and it emitted a wonderful scent. I had several people try smelling the Yankee candle.  Each and everyone said there was hardly any aroma.  Please stop making excuses.  Someone.dropped the ball and covid was just an easy excuse."
5,2022-06-26,"Once again Yankee Candle, you're the best! My son bought this for me on Mother's Day, and since then, I've lit it every day and it makes the whole house smell great! I only have about 1/4 of the candle left, and it smells just as good now as it did when I first opened it. YC may be a little more pricey than other candles, but the quality is top notch. Couldn't buy a better candle. Now - let's talk about the JARS. It would be nice for YC to come up with different container shapes and sizes. The jar isn't the most attractive candle holder! I'd like to see them come up with ceramic or stone holders, in colors like grey and khaki and rose. Maybe they will!"
5,2020-07-20,"This has the reminiscent smell of previously bought Yankee candles. It filled the entire first floor of my home, 1200 ft.² with scent. And it smells heavenly. No skimp this time on Scent. It took 20 hours to burn half of it. So, it has lost some on longevity. Let's See how Long it takes to finish them up! Will return! They smelled great, but unfortunately some of the candles that I ordered had short wicks. Not even halfway through the candle the wick just disappeared. It happened in about 50% of the purchases. I believe I bought nine candles. Don't hold me to that but somewhere around that figure. But it was definitely at least half of the purchases were defective. The lilac smelled great, but some of the other sents that I bought were barely odoriferous! (Could barely smell them)"
5,2020-11-24,"When we lost my mom her personal touch was lost, My dad asked me if I knew what candles mom liked. Yankee was always a fave. I sent two of the lilac candles to Dad. He said the house was feeling right again. Thank you for helping my family heal and remember at the same time."
5,2016-01-22,"One of a trio of Yankee candle floral scents I like to burn in my master bedroom. The whole room smells like a garden, almost like the fresh flowers themselves. As an added bonus, the lighting is sublime and because our room is not enormous, the candles add actual warmth, very welcome on colder days, even in Georgia, which gets its fair share of cold days in Winter.The large jars burn a long time and I don't think I have found a brand that's worth what these Yankees are. The price you pay for them is worth it because they smell so wonderful and true to what they are labeled. I have not tried one nature scent yet that did not delight me."
5,2022-03-17,"Maybe that's intentional but it was unexpected.  I keep checking the fragrances listed in the description and don't see any rose scent listed there.  Not that it matters to me.  I'm loving the scent of this candle.  Yankee Candles are my favorite.  The large jars last a long time.  Some don't always burn all the way across - I guess that's called tunneling?  The scent on this one is strong, even when unlit.  The wick burns well.  I do have to keep trimming it to keep the flame from getting too tall.Think I'll go hunting for one with actual rose scent to compare."
5,2018-02-27,"Fantastic price, fantastic shipping, and a fantastic candle. I ordered 2 of these, and both were shipped in a secure, candle-shaped cardboard frame within the box so there were no issues with the glass breaking or cracking during transit. The Pink Sands candle itself has a unique smell that is hard to describe; there are hints of citrus and roses in the middle of a clean, crisp, semisweet airy cloud of awesome. I absolutely love it, and have yet to find another candle quite like it. If you're a fan of crisp scents (e.g., Clean Cotton) but also like soft sweet candles (e.g., Buttercream), you should definitely try this. Highly recommended!"
5,2020-01-11,"There is just no candle company anywhere that makes as good a candle as Yankee. Their scents are amazing, the containers are great sizes, and these candles burn FOREVER! They seem pricey, but truthfully, they aren’t—because they last so much longer than other candies. Watch for third party sales— you can get “used” candles—which are essentially just candles white boxes have been opened and then box and candle was returned for some reason—NOT burned. Those are available sometimes from Amazon and they are a few dollars cheaper. Great gifts, too. My family knows when in doubt, give Mom a Yankee candle."
5,2022-07-19,"I love this particular scent for easing my Anxiety at night, it helps me calm down and get ready to fall asleep.I would recommend putting it out before you go to bed, since it can wear the candles wax down significantly. (The scent will linger in your room even after the flame is out)My recommendation is to never blow the candle out, put the lid back on (so it’s sealed) and let the flame go out on its own.Whenever you blow the candle out it can give off that waxy birthday candle smell which overpowers the original scent and ruins the whole point of it.Other than that it’s a very pleasant candle to keep around just in case."
5,2021-08-03,"I absolutely LOVE the scent from this candle.We have so enjoyed all of the Yankee Candles we've purchased, but this scent truly reminds you of walking along a beach...and when you're in the desert of Coachella Valley, a walk on the beach in 120 degree heat is a very nice thought.This is the second one we've purchased, and love it soooooo much.  Perfect for summer when you're longing to get to the beach."
5,2022-07-19,"We were all over Italy for the month of May and during that time all the jasmine trees were in bloom and absolutely beautiful.  The smell was wonderful, so when I got home to an area that does not have jasmine trees, I ordered this Yankee Candle in the Midnight Jasmiine scent.  OMG !  Every time I light it up, the scent takes me back to a place and time that was so special !This Yankee Candle in this jasmine scent is recommended without reservation."
5,2019-05-28,"You can’t go wrong with Yankee Candles. I bought Bath and Body Works 3-wick candles during their winter sale online but nothing compares to the original makers of long-lasting scented candles. I found this particular scent is actually cheaper on Amazon vs. purchasing in stores. I ordered it at 10:30pm last night and it arrived at 10:30 am the next day. Saves me time, money, and gas! The 3 candles I bought on Bath and Body Works didn’t last long. I could no longer light the wicks even though there’s still a substantial amount of candle wax in the glass container. Plus the scent wears out fast. I do not experience those problems with a Yankee Candle.Tip: Burn the candle for at least 2 hours to get rid of odors. Extend the life of your candle by trimming the burnt part of the wick from time to time."
5,2021-11-21,"My daughter absolutely loves the smell of Yankee Candle Pink Sands! It has a strong throw that I find a little overwhelming in an area like a small bathroom, but it doesn't bother my daughter one bit. The scent incorporates citrus, fruity, floral, woodsy, and musk all in one. My daughter has loved this scent for over 2 years, and still isn't tired of it. I got her another one for Christmas. :)"
5,2021-05-23,"I usually burn Storm Watch in the summer, but Sun & Sand has made itself a new home into my seasonal collections. Smells: Strong notes of the beach, sunscreen lotion, light citrus/musk..Love lighting this one while I play video games on cool summer nights with the window open, definitely makes me feel like I'm at the beach even though I'm far far away lol, brings back summer memories of going to the pool & swimming with family & friends when I was younger too."
5,2022-03-25,It has a very warm cozy smell.  I love turning out the lights and lighting up my Yankee (one of many aromas) along with some other led decor and spring flowers and plants and totally relaxing and thinking. I am never at peace more. It is truly enjoyable for me. It has plenty of throw. Same thing goes for the Dried Lavender and Oak.  Thanks YANKEE!!!  Their service is also GREAT!! Can't beat this. These are the companies we all miss so much
5,2022-04-09,"Did you ever have a scent that reminds you of happy days gone by?  This is the one for me!  Lilac bushes surrounded me throughout my life and this candle brings back feelings of love, peace and all round JOY!  Hope to never run out of this scent!"
5,2021-03-04,"I am a candle and/or wax melt freak and needed something new and 'Spring-ish.""  I like the scent but I am not WOWED like some of the other; but that is me and not the candle.  What I really like about it is I don't have to burn it for very long- (let's say an hour) and the scent stays for a day or longer which is rare.  It is a little strong actually; so I usually have it in a different room to her than the one I am in at the time.  Overall; I like it. WIll I buy this scent again?  Maybe but as I said that's me and not the candle"
5,2022-07-29,Yankee candles are by far a favorite of mine and I buy many different type candles. But…. Nothing equals the smell of yankee. They have an aroma that’s just amazingly delicious! If you pick a flower scent your getting a flower garden in your home. A fruit scent the house is like apple pie. Their long lasting beautiful for gifts and definitely live up to the price that you pay for one.
5,2017-08-05,"Work in a nail salon and I hate it when people say that the place has a strong chemical smells. After all it's hard to keep it all contained there are some thing that leak through. But with this a lot of my customers are always complimenting the smell and some even took a picture so they can buy it later. I've never bought this one before so I did it on a whim since everyone was raving about it. The candle was expensive but worth it, I've bought other candles and they go out within a week!! But this is long lasting especially if they're burned all day like I have them."
5,2020-08-21,"I bought several candles and made the mistake of buying some with just a ""lid "" as opposed to this kind, which is a secure ""tumbler style"" lid, that seals in the scent both before and after you burn the candle.The ones with the ""lid"" that just ""sit on top "" of the candle ""  caused the candles to arrive with absolutelyNO SCENT AT ALL.  So please be careful, and order this style .  I wasted a lot of $ on my Yankee Candles."
5,2022-04-30,"I love this candle! Lilac Blossoms is one of my favorite Yankee Candle scents and when I can afford it I have to buy one. These candles always last forever and I re-use the jars for other things so it's a win-win for me. This was an especially great buy because of the low price! Yankee Candles are twice that price unless you catch a sale, and with my Prime I got it shipped for free, sealed in it's actual unopened box, the scent as strong as it's supposed to be. I'm extremely happy with my purchase!"
5,2020-11-07,"I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about the Yankee Candles not being authentic on Amazon, but figured I would try it since it was on sale. I liked this particular scent (Pink Sands). It did take a long time to burn, which is something I appreciate since candles are so expensive. If you like the scent and prefer something more mild in terms of potency, I would recommend."
5,2022-06-20,"Have you ever been to a fancy smancy hotel or spa and said: ""WOW, this smell fancy"", that's what this white gardenia fragrance is.Most fancy hotels use gardenia essence sprayed on the lobby walls to make a statement when people walk in.Put this candle near the entrance of your house and people will complement you."
5,2022-08-18,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 Well packaged so this lovely scented candle arrived undamaged and ready to enjoy!  I was worried it might get broken in transit but nope!  Very pleased, would definitely buy again might try some other scents as well. Scent is nicely balanced, not over bearing or too perfumery.  Natural clean scent."
5,2021-12-28,"This is one of my FAVORITE scents that Yankee Candle has during Fall/Halloween time. This year I had to buy it from Amazon, because Yankee didn’t release it for Halloween. I was told they just weren’t going to this year. Well they must have gotten the hint that people weren’t happy, cause they did a month later and on sale. But I had gotten mine from here so…but I’m still very happy I get them!"
5,2012-01-29,"If you like the scent of gardenias, this candle will scent your entire room.  My mother loves the smell of gardenias and when she moved to Palm Desert, California had gardenia plants planted in the garden beds under her bedroom window.  In the spring and fall she has 200 gardenia blooms typically scenting the air, but what about the rest of the year?To give her year-round gardenia scent, I bought her this for her birthday (January 24) and she just called and says she's sitting in her bedroom, reading a book with dog in lap, with this gardenia scented candle lit--the fragrance is suffusing the whole room. She says it's a light, soft fragrant scent, not heavy and overpowering.  She has thanked me several times for this gift--seems to have the candle lit at all times of the day and night.  It offers 100-150 hours of fragrance.  I'm going to buy one for myself for Valentines Day in lilac--she's convinced me.  A great gift for someone or for yourself--buy one in YOUR fragrant scent."
5,2020-08-01,Strong scents give me migraines so I usually don’t burn candles or use essential oils in my home. I bought small jars of these rose scented candles for my son’s preschool teachers for Valentine’s Day last year and thought they smelled really nice. So I got this one for myself to try. It smells amazing and isn’t too strong and over powering (no headaches at all) but you can still smell it too. I had it burning during a family birthday party recently and several people asked what it was cause they really liked it.
5,2022-08-12,"Growing up we had a midnight jasmine plant by the front door. My father took care of this magnificent plant and when we started dating, the lucky young men were instantly impressed by how sweet our home smelled and it was a good firsthand warning  of how precious his daughters were. ☺️"
5,2021-05-10,"As of my review, the large tumbler was $16 from Amazon, about 1/2 the price Yankee candle charges via website or store. Amazing value for the price, I got several for myself and mother's day gifts. My only issue is the smell isn't as strong as some other candles from Yankee, but it is very pleasant. They may be older stock since the labels have since changed, but they arrived in Yankee candle boxes and are beautiful."
5,2022-05-17,"I really like this scent. I don’t like strong overpowering scents and this one is not. It’s a  clean, nice scent. Perfect for any room or for giving as a gift."
5,2019-12-05,"Yankee Candles Large Jar Candles for Only $12.99 is unheard of usually unless you buy several, they have flaws or the scents are discontinued.I was surprised to find my favorite scent at this price, so I had to buy one.  The wax is perfectly flat on top without any missing areas along the sides the jar and the wick is perfectly placed in the center. It’s perfect!!"
5,2022-07-07,"The house smells so good, just like lilacs! This would be an awesome gift but I buy the candles for me! They remind me of me of the lilac bushes growing around my grandmother's house, when I was a child. Will definitely purchase again this summer, the scent is so soothing."
5,2015-09-02,"This was giving as a gift to my dear,  super busy sister in law--who juggles running her own Doctor's practice (on cal 24/7-no matter what) and raising 2 beautiful, and super talented teens that preform all over the U.S. with their various dance troops.  Yankee candles is the one thing I have found that makes her able to slow down a second and get to be ""in the moment"" for a second or two.  She has them all over their home, and the 1st thing she does when she gets home from her grueling day--she lights quite a few of her candles---(I am sure they all around her large bath-tub)  I noticed her mom came by and lit one that was not yet burning----the one I had just given her daughter.  I know what to always buy her any occasion. Unless a person just does not care for candles--you can not!! go wrong in giving these (and this exact brand!!!) for much appreciated gifts.  Thank you Amazon for making them available :o"
5,2022-04-28,I am a fan of Yankee candles. They last longer than normal candles and the smell is wonderful. I have only ever had one bad experience and that was because I think it was left on a truck too long during the summer. The smell of this candle is not overpowering at all but fills a room nicely.
5,2022-05-06,Definitely a favorite Candle.  The first one arrived with the jar completely Shattered.  The replacement was perfect.  Will be reordering soon.
5,2020-05-15,"My concern when purchasing stuff like this through Amazon is always authenticity. This was one of my fave Yankee Candle scents so I can confirm it is authentic. It's so lovely. Obviously scent is personal to everyone so that's all I can confirm :) Package arrived intact, safe and sound."
5,2021-01-13,Purchased the Midnight Jasmine. I fell in love with the smell at the Yankee Store as it reminded of me of the streets in Syria covered in Jasmine flowers. Will be gifting this to all my friends and family who want to a reminder of the smells back home. This lasts such a long time and I will continue to purchase it.
5,2020-09-15,"I purchased this candle.  The first time it showed up broken and melted and it has been really hot.  The company promptly sent me another candle.  Upon receiving the 2nd candle it was also broken and melted due to the heat!  So the company had me return the second candle and I did.  Then I got most of my money back.  Not the companies fault, I would buy from them again just not in the HEAT of the summer for a candle that melts.  The packaging was also good on the product."
5,2022-01-13,"Pink Sands has always been my favorite scent of Yankee candles, it’s so convenient to be able to order my favorite candle ~ my signature scent and have it delivered every two months or however frequent you want to receive it! Very happy with my purchase! One more thing… It was packaged impeccably!!"
5,2018-01-31,The throw on this candle is amazing! Whenever I search through reviews I'm always wondering about the throw on the candle. I want my candles very strong scented and to have an amazing throw. I want my whole house scented. This candle is the one. My husband even loves it.
5,2022-08-16,"Fans of springtime lilacs can enjoy the fragrance, year round.  The double wicks provide double the fun.  The classy cylinder jar is almost filled to the brim with gorgeously colored purple wax.  Enjoy the hours of ""fake"" flowers."
5,2020-04-18,I am so glad I found the candles on here this is one of my favorite scents from Yankee candle.  I ended up ordering 2 just because they were prices so well and they smell so good in my house.  So far after using them a couple of times they look as though they have never been used.
5,2021-07-03,"I'm kidding. Kind of. Jasmin is probably my favorite scent ever, I was really excited to find this Yankee Candle super discounted on Prime Day. It smells amazing and has become my go-to at the end of a long day."
5,2022-05-20,"This candle smells amazing! It arrived today, very well packaged and intact. I love the way it smelled even before lighting it. Now my entire apartment smells wonderful. Like an outdoor summer garden, warm breezes and sunshine! Love it! 🎉🥰💐"
5,2021-03-31,"I LOVEEE pink sands, it smells unlike any scent I've ever found.... it's slightly fruity, sort of smells like a pie, but has a warm, sort of sandalwood scent... I always treat myself to this candle every year, there's nothing like it! Also, the color of the candle itself is a super cute, pale pink. Great as a gift as well, everyone I know has loved it!"
5,2021-03-12,This smell is amazing ..got this for my brother's wife.  She told me it was ok and she could find someone to give it to.. last present she ever gets from me lol . Yes this is giftable to people that appreciate receiving gifts.  Definitely learned my lesson about being nice and spending money on people I don't really like.  Merry Christmas Biatch haha
5,2020-04-02,"This candle has the best scent. It reminds me a lot of White Shoulders perfume by Elizabeth Arden, which is my favorite perfume. It completely fills a room with its soft sweet floral aroma. It burns for a long time, and easily competes with other more expensive candles on the market. I'm glad I bought this and will definitely repurchase."
5,2021-12-23,This candle is outstanding and will make the perfect gift for anyone who loves candles. The sent is strong and last long after its put out.
5,2021-12-29,"Beach walk is my favorite scent in the Yankee Candle lineup. It has a bright scent profile with floral undertones that you can’t quite put your finger on. It is aptly named, too - the scent makes me think of a cozy beachfront house with the windows open on a cool day."
5,2022-05-23,"I ordered two candles and they came promptly, well packed and in good condition.  I was very pleased.  I have not burned the candle yet, but this candle is beautiful and a lovely spring color!  Thank you for offering this scent."
5,2022-06-23,This is a great flower candle that is great and for sure a must have on sale
5,2022-02-01,"This candle is everything. I’ve had so many people come to my house and say, “wow your house smells so nice”…. Yep, that’s the candle. I burn it all day long! Only recommendation is to get a wick cutter that is long. I don’t have that and wish I did."
5,2022-07-01,I stopped burning candles as it leaves soot on everything. The scents are great but if you don’t burn the candle the scent do doesn’t last.
5,2022-08-01,Before even opening these candles the scent is lovely--and they are packaged so well that there is no chance of accidental breakage during shipping. They are large and colorful--well worth the cost. I will be buying more candles from this company.
5,2018-05-28,"As soon as removed from protective packaging from this YANKEE LARGE JAR ""BEACH WALK"" CANDLE I caught a whiff of it's SWEET FRESH FRAGRANCE. When lit, the room fills with the SWEET FRESH SCENT.To be honest, this pale blue ""BEACH WALK"" candle caught my eye because of high customer ratings and AMAZON MERCHANTS who offer at substantial savings. What does a walk on the beach smell like, after all; and do I want my home to smell like the mysterious scent? Not floral, herbal or musk. I highly recommend ""BEACH WALK"" for its RICH FRESH SCENT."
5,2021-12-29,All these people writing false reviews about yankee candles not smelling should be banned from reviewing. I have always and always will love these candles. Yes there are a few scents that are a bit to feminine for my taste but even they smell delectable. Yankee candle you get a 110% from me. I just wish I could afford them more often than I can.
5,2022-03-11,I live near the Yankee Candle Factory Flagship Store but I’ll buy my candles on Amazon. Amazon has some  great discounted prices. This candle was great quality. It was shipped in protective cardboard. We really enjoyed the scent.
5,2022-07-10,"The fragrance is lovely and powerful. Not too powerful, just gorgeous. It’s hard to describe but I’m so happy I chose it. Yankee Candle does a very good job..Thank you, Smileamazon…"
5,2021-03-02,"Hi! This is one of my very favorite YC fragrances. It was packaged safely and arrived quickly. It looks and smells exactly like the Lilac Blossoms candle I expected. Spring is coming; so this will definitely help to get me in the mood!Order with confidence! Whenever I can, I will certainly order again!"
5,2022-06-20,The whole house smelled like lilacs. Excellent.
5,2020-12-20,"I enjoy the scent of this candle, Pink Sands.  It is not overwhelming but it is not so subtle that it’s undetectable. I’ve only burned the candle a couple of times but for several hours each time and longevity appears to be average for a Yankee candle. I would not  hesitate to give as a gift.  Price was very reasonable."
5,2021-05-16,"This is my forever favorite candle. I have them all over my home. Love the large size, give me a 3 wick one Yankee, please. I burn for an hour or two a few nights a week. I love it!! Very calming. I store my unused jars open in my dresser drawer with my shawls, t-shirts and sweaters."
5,2019-02-12,"Honestly I ordered this particular candle because the price was good and I love candles so why not?  I’m so happy I took a chance in this scent!  It’s beautiful.  It has a strong rose base with other floral notes.  The throw is terrific.  In an average sized room the scent is quite strong and just permeates the whole area.  If you are looking for something subtle, then this will not be the candle for you."
5,2021-12-05,"I like this candle for its pretty color reminiscent of the inside of a seashell and for its scent which is balanced and not overpowering (not too floral, not too citrus, not too spicy, not too musky). I find it pleasant and relaxing. This is a repeat purchase."
5,2020-12-06,These candles smell amazing!! I could smell the pink sand through the box and I instantly fell in love. Definitely worth the money! There were delivered together in a Amazon box and each candle was separated in to its own yankee candle box. I’m giving it to me sister for Christmas so it’s nice that each candle is individually packaged with its own protection.
5,2020-02-24,Fresh Cut Roses is one of my long time favourites. It's also one of Yankee Candles strongest scents. I can light one of these in my living room and enjoy the fragrance pretty much throughout the downstairs rooms of my cozy home. Yankee has always been a brand I know I can depend on. It's also very nice having it delivered to my front door free of charge within a couple of days after I order. Thank you Amazon.
5,2021-04-10,This Lilac Blossom candle smells absolutely AMAZING!!! The soft delicate scent of lilacs fills the whole room but it's not over powering. This is by far my favorite candle from Yankee Candle. This is my second purchase of this particular candle. The burning time is very long also. Highly recommend as a gift for Mother's Date!!
5,2020-02-24,"I always buy Yankee Candles so when I saw the great price offered I had to try this scent. I usually wouldn't buy without first smelling the candle, but I've never gone wrong with this brand.  I love the scent, it turned out to be a light floral with a hint of citrus and it fills my entire house. Yankee candles burn slow and last a long time. I will definitely be a repeat customer."
5,2018-08-30,"""Calm Quiet Place"" smells like what youd imagine Rose from the titanics perfume smelled like.. soft and subtle but elegant and beautiful.. makes you feel good inside 🙂I lit this candle in the kitchen (open concept) so it could smell up my livingroom and kitchen etc. well after an hour or so i didnt smell it much so id say it isnt strong enough for larg areas.. however, i moved the candle to my master room and the scent exploded! it smells Godly in here! i will always keep this scent in my home :)"
5,2022-07-24,Love the sent of jasmine I would love for the sent to be longer wherever I see these candles for sale I tend to always purchase a few as I use them on a daily.
5,2022-03-04,"I haven't purchased a yankee candle in quite a few years, but since bath and body works have gotten so expensive, I thought I would give it a try. Really impressive scent, fills our family room/kitchen/dining area with beautiful, not overpowering scent. Will buy more in the future!"
5,2022-08-17,This is my favorite Yankee Candle scent and the quality is as if I purchased it in a Yankee Candle store.  The candle was securely packaged for delivery.  This will become my number one way of buying it.
5,2022-06-26,"The scent is not overwhelming. It smells clean. It does fill the house, but it just makes the house smell clean not like I'm trying to burn out my nostrils. 👍👍"
5,2022-04-19,"Loved the scent of this candle burning. Very calming to me, as I love the beach.  Lasts a long time if you trim the wick correctly. Order it. You will love it if you love the beach."
5,2021-11-02,"I love the scent of Pink Sands, it is the best! Hope they never discontinue this scent. It last a long time,  you don’t have to burn the candle a long time. Just let it pool after lighting then blow candle out. The scent last a long time…"
5,2020-02-08,I have always loved the smell of lilacs and this candle does not disappoint!! It doesn't take long at all for it to fill the house with the scent of fresh lilacs so I don't have to burn it for very long. This candle will last me for quite a long time so it really is worth the price!!
5,2022-05-03,"We love Yankee Candles and we think that are the best, they never loose their scent , they keep burning for ever, and for less than $16 per large bar, it was a bargain"
5,2020-11-19,I absolutely love this candle! I use to have lilac trees at my previous home that were my absolute favorite because they smelt so lovely and this candle smells just like them. Having this candle smells so wonderful and makes me so nostalgic. The other positive thing I would like to mention is how wonderfully they are packaged! I have bought three yankee candles off Amazon now and each one is packaged with great care! I 100% recommend!!!
5,2021-01-20,"I love Yankee Candles. This scent is definitely one of my favorites. Light and calming, this scent features vanilla undertones with berry, citrus, and melon top notes. It smells exactly like a tropical vacation on a pink sand beach! I enjoy this scent in my home (especially during the winter)."
5,2021-11-09,My last candle I sent back it had no scent. The new candle scent was way stronger. I immediately could smell the scent from the unopened box. The aroma quickly filled my entire home and burns and smells beautiful. Thank you Yankee!
5,2022-06-14,This has to be my 3rd or 4th candle I’ve bought from Yankee Candle and smell is not overpowering. It’s perfect and always get large candle so it last forever !
5,2021-08-09,"Growing up on the beaches of Southern California, Sea & Ski was a familiar scent! This candle reminds me so much of it."
5,2017-09-08,"This candle smells exactly like it says it does. It smells just like lilacs, and it doesn’t smell artificial at all to me. The fragrance is strong enough to be noticeable and pleasant, without overwhelming (probably since it’s floral).I was nervous to buy this because other people seem to have received broken or melted candles. I didn’t have this issue. The candle was in multiple layers of sturdy and supportive packaging.I wouldn’t recommend leaving this product on your doorstep for too long on a warm day... I think that may be how people get melted ones. You can get a notification from amazon when it arrives so that doesn’t happen."
5,2022-03-06,"smells fantastic, my mom's favorite so I took advantage of a good price and got her one, this brand is pricey but usually has the best scents and long lasting burn times"
5,2022-04-17,"This candle is by far one of my favorites. It's a calming, wonderful scent and hard to come by. Worth every penny!"
5,2021-05-12,"Yankee Candles always live up to the hype in my experiences.  I bought the lilac scented candle and it smells great!  It is a large size, in an attractive and substantial jar, and has an attractive design on its label.  If I wanted to give someone a candle, I think a Yankee Candle would be a winner."
5,2022-04-13,This is likely the best candle I've ever owned. Jasmine scent is fresh and not artificial and the scent projects very well but is not overbearing. Absolutely excellent.
5,2018-11-10,Second review.  Although these are my favorite candles one was broke again.  First review. These are my favorite smelling candle and they last a long time. I ordered four.  Althouth they were packed well one was broken.  The top was upside down ant cruched the top.  I still was able to use it but would recommend watch when packing.  I will still continue to buy these candles anyways
5,2021-05-18,"Yankee Candles are my favorite but there is not a store near me.  I was very happy to know that Amazon sold them in my favorite scent, lavender.  These are the only candles I use as they are safe and lasts a long time.  Variety of scents."
5,2020-06-20,"I got the jasmine scent and I smelled l it immediately after I opened the box it was shipped in, so it’s quite strong! I wanted a strong candle so it’s perfect for me, but if you want a mild scent the jasmine one is not for you. It’s slow burning and the wick is great quality. I love it, and would buy it again for myself or as a gift."
5,2021-11-08,I love this scent I hVe 3 dogs in the house and they make stuff stink sometimes this candel drowns out the smell of my 3 dogs its good and not too strong lasted 2 weeks had it burning a long time every day though it smells like a garden of flowers love love love deff recommend for a gift ❤
5,2019-02-03,"I had many candles in the past and non of them left as dominant, pleasant scent as Yankee Candle.I love that the scent fills up the room while they are burning and stay long after they are put out.In my opinion one of the best companies. The only matter is to pick your own scent. And do not follow people suggestions because everyone is unique. So far I have three favorite ones:1. Lilac Blossom2. Pink Sands3. Sage and Citrus"
5,2021-07-16,"This is the best “beach smelling” candle that exists! It literally smells like sitting on the beach on a hot summer day… sun, sand, salty breezes and coppertone sunscreen… like a vacation without leaving home! I love it!"
5,2020-04-21,"Someone recommended this scented candle to me.  I am usually into the more natural scents, like vanilla and eucalyptus, mint, etc. This candle is more of a candy scent- kind of like a starburst or something, but it's not overpowering. I actually quite enjoy it and it seems like it has a long long burn life. Great purchase!"
5,2021-02-13,My first Yankee Candle and I'm impressed! Even burning as long as you trim wick consistently and burn to edges.  Lilac is my favorite scent and this smells so natural and not at all artificial.  Will last me a long time and I'll definitely buy another and try more scents.
5,2014-12-18,"Love the fragrance this gardenia candle exudes. I don't often buy Yankee Candle products, as they are often more costly than I prefer to pay for, but it is a challenge to find gardenia candles where I live, and gardenia is my mom's favorite fragrance, so she was thrilled to have a large jar candle with such a lovely gardenia scent. Isn't overwhelming, but strong enough to make any room smell better! This jar candle provided months of use, even after lighting every day! I'd say this is worth the cost."
5,2012-02-21,"This candle has a lovely, true-rose scent and Yankee is one of the few that I've been able to find, lately, still offering some of the true-flower scents. A party candle company from which I used to buy has just about done away with all of their true-flower scents (I preferred theirs to any others, but since they no longer offer, it's a moot point!), so finding this available on good-ol'-Amazon, was nice for me...The scent is fairly strong (which I like) when the candle is burning and the candle color is a pretty, classic tea rose flower pink (not garish ""bubble gum pink"", thankfully wouldn't have bought!)...I like it all around, just fine."
5,2020-08-12,I find the Yankee Candle brand to be hit and miss. This is by far my favorite scent from the company. This candle is strong yet floral and not overpowering. The candles price on Amazon can't be beat. This candle is long lasting in burn time and scent.  Grab a match and light up this great candle.
5,2021-03-06,"The first time I found this Lilac candle I was taken back to when I was a child walking to school in Michigan and the smell of the lilacs! I was so excited I bought it and just bought several more. I love this fragrance. It's light, but strong enough to fill the air with the smell of lilacs."
5,2020-03-14,"This scent is my favorite of the Yankee candle collection...amazon prices are cheaper but the quality is still high.  This scent smells like suntan oil and makes me feel like it's summer all year long in my house.  It's mild but this one candle, can be smelled throughout the house.  Will forevermore buy Yankee candle from Amazon."
5,2021-12-28,"The smell of the roses in this candle are absolutely amazing. We gave this as a gift, and the recipient was so excited to get it because it is her favorite scent. Lovely"
5,2020-12-07,"I purchased this candle after Target stopped selling their lilac candles (which I was extremely distraught over). I don’t usually buy Yankee Candles because I think they are overpriced but this was one definitely worth it! I just purchased a second because my first is getting a little low after several months of owning it. Both of my jars cakes with weird bubbles in them, which would make the aesthetics a little less appealing when gift giving. But, in my opinion, a candle is a candle as long as it can burn and smell good. Will continue to make this my #1 lilac candle brand."
5,2020-02-01,"Beautiful Candle ! Smells amazing ! The candle on left I received as a gift and loved it so much, when I wanted to buy another I realized I couldn’t find a candle called “lilac” just “lilac blossoms“ so I was concerned it may differ in scent somewhat. Nope! Smells wonderful just like the original one I had, great candle I love it  !💜"
5,2021-03-17,"This is my favorite spring/ summer candle. Seriously the best scent! Yankee candle is worth the money too because I light it every day for the reccomend 3-4 hours at a time, the scent fills my entire kitchen and 1 large jar lasts about a month."
5,2022-05-14,I was concerned that the candle may be old and therefore have less scent due to the low price.  I was so happy to find that it was a very strong scent of lilacs and the candle was just beautiful!
5,2013-02-22,Jasmine is one of my favorite fragrances ever! It is absolutely heavenly. It is also a known aphrodisiac for those who are unaware. I love the size and value of this candle as well as the scent that emanates from it. Whenever I burn this particular candle house guests will always make a comment on how great my home smells. I repurchase Midnight Jasmine because it yields so many positive compliments. It's a clean and lovely floral! Try it and you'll see what I mean!
5,2021-08-28,Reminds me every day of the lilac tree we had in our front yard when I was a child.  Normally not a fan of flower scents but this scent is spot-on.  I have it on reorder every 2 months.  Love it!
5,2022-07-17,Sent to my husband as a gift and he LOVES it! You can never go wrong with the intense smell and longevity of Yankee brand!
5,2021-06-29,Woohoo!!! I absolutely am a pink sands gal. This scent though is lovely. I light it downstairs and it smells great throughout both upstairs and downstairs. Also instead of 29.50 I paid 16.99 oh yes. I completely recommend.
5,2021-03-20,Great candle! I got a great deal on this and was way cheaper than a Yankee candle that size! good smell and great quality
5,2022-06-09,"Loved this and ordered twice.  I don't know about gifting because it is a distinct flavor.  For lilac lovers, its great"
5,2019-03-25,"I love the smell and formulation of this candle. The burn time is very stretched out and the aroma is very soothing, and comforting. I personally keep these in my bathrooms, because they match the aesthetic and the atmosphere of the room. Good quality wicks, long burn time, and an amazing, fresh scent. Highly recommended. This would also make a great gift. The smell is highly likeable!"
5,2022-01-12,"Strong scent and every guest that I had in my house loved the scent, I never pay regular price for this tho, always 10-15 maxThey last a long time"
5,2021-04-10,Beautiful scent! Has my small apartment smelling wonderful!  Just in case it doesn't state what I ordered the pink sands
5,2022-06-26,I love all Yankee Candles this one is no different! Best thing it was on sale.. Great scent and fires up fine.
5,2021-01-30,"This is my favorite candle!!! Lacander is my favorite scent, but the lemon lavender is even better!! It's soothing and calming!"
5,2022-04-03,I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Valentine’s Day and she said it makes the entire apartment look and smell beautiful!
5,2022-05-18,This candle smells great. Yankee candle never seems to disappoint.  I got this on sale and will definitely buy again.
5,2019-04-28,"The price was about $10 cheaper on Amazon than on the Yankee Candle website and shipping was free with Prime, so you can't beat it. The smell is subtle and beautiful; not overwhelming at all, so it's a safe bet for a gift. I bought two for my mother in law and her sister for Easter. They both loved them. I will get one for my house because it's a great spring/summer scent."
5,2020-08-16,This was the first time purchasing the Beach Walk scent.  I really love it!  It’s a nice clean fragrance and has a great throw. This candle definitely reminds me of the beach. The downside is that; my husband liked it too.  He stole it and brought it to his office!
5,2019-05-01,"I took a chance and ordered this Lilac candle, and had never smelled it before.. it was a top rated candle on the Yankee site as well so I thought Id give it a try. So glad I did! I LOVE the smell and its the perfect spring/summer scent. So so glad I took the chance on it through Amazon, great price, and great smelling candle. Love it! Will definitely be ordering again."
5,2021-05-26,I love that they come so well packaged. You can save it and send one at another time. As always the smell was great. A present for my bestie every year and she just lives it. Great value for the money.
5,2021-04-01,"This candle is my very favorite - the scent if wonderful, clean and refreshing!  I am so glad Amazon had these, and at a good price, since the stores are almost non-existent in our area.  Will order more!"
5,2020-10-20,"I thought this candle would last like a day, it's been 4 and it's only half way done. The scent is nice and chill, not over powering like the other one I purchased that, I can barely stand for more than 3 minutes. This is a great scented candle."
5,2021-05-25,This Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Lilac Blossoms has a very strong and lasting good smell and lingering in room for a long time.  I don't have a good nose but I can smell good aroma from this candle so this must be good.
5,2020-11-28,Great customer service.  Instantly!  I’ll buy my candles from them from here on out.  Customer service is sometimes more important than the product.  But they also sell YANKEE CANDLES!  My fav!  Thanks for helping me with my questions and concerns. You put my worries to rest
5,2015-06-13,"Wow! This really takes the cake. A mix of islands and luxury. This candle is my absolute favorite scent. I can't get enough. It transports you to a romantic, sensual place, with thoughts of island fresh water and palm trees. When the candle gets low, I stop burning it until I have that new favorite person coming over. It leaves you feeling pampered and it gives a distinct scent for your guests to remember you by."
5,2022-05-10,My granddaughter loves Pink Sand. I bought it for Christmas and after smelling it she couldn’t wait!
5,2022-04-06,"I easily get headaches from air fresheners, perfumes and candles, but this particular scent is soothing and tolerable. I can have my candle lit all day without worrying about a headache. Very hard to find at stores."
5,2021-12-24,Great smell
5,2021-05-21,"Yankee Candle's  Large Jar Candle in the Lilac Blossoms is a light aroma that does not overwhelm your senses. In the large size, I accept it to last a long time.  Spring is in the air."
5,2021-03-24,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 Smells great added my own stickers and customized it for myself"
5,2015-03-30,"This candle is absolutely my favorite. When I first received it I thought the scent was going to be a little too earthy or musky, but when it's lit it smells absolutely wonderful and fills my whole house with the scent of real roses, not an artificial rose scent. It's lovely and calming. I absolutely love it.**Update 3/7/16**I ordered this candle again since the last one has now been completely burned down, and for some reason this new one isn't as heavily scented. While it's burning I don't experience the same amount of fragrance as I have in the past or what I've come to expect with Yankee Candles. I don't know if this is an older candle, but I did notice the label says ""A passion for fragrance"" underneath ""Yankee Candle"" and the candle I bought previously with a strong fragrance says ""America's Best Loved Candle"". I'm pretty disappointed that this new candle doesn't fill my home with the scent like previous candles have. I might take it to the Yankee Candle store to see if I can exchange it. Hopefully it's not a fake."
5,2021-06-21,I got it for a great price 16.88 yankeeThis is my 2nd time ordering this candle scent i love it. Its perfect for the summer. This was the cheapest i paid for a yankee large candle
5,2022-08-09,"Smells wonderful!!! Lasts a long time. Burns clean. Do not hesitate!  Soft, powdery smell."
5,2021-03-04,"I love the scent of Bayberry best, but the Pink Sands has a glow to it that makes it more visually appealing.  The scent is muted, the longevity is very good provided the wick gets trimmed before each lighting, the price is better than most, and it would make a fine gift."
5,2022-04-28,This is the only candle sent sent that I buy. Just beautiful and smells like fresh cut rose’s.
5,2019-01-02,"When these are on sale, I always pick up a few.  The Yankee Lilac is by far the most natural lilac scent I have enjoyed.  There was a soy candle that once came close, but the constancy of Yankee makes it my go to for classic lilac.  I can't stand the complicated sweet, or 'air', or layered beach night.  I want a simpler truer scent and that is what I get here."
5,2022-06-29,I just love these brand of candles<33 they smell so good and smell up the house
5,2020-11-13,so far with burning for most of a day the scent is a little on the soft side compared to most candlesthe Burn down rate is real good and shows that this one is going to have a long burn life in itwould recommend them as a buy if on sale!
5,2021-03-02,"I purchased two of these candles and they were absolutely wonderful! I should have known that Amazon had everything, but I am thrilled that I found them  and I would continue to purchase more."
5,2022-03-27,Used for a romantic get away with rose petals everywhere even in places the shouldn't have been.  The room smelled like a rose bomb!
5,2022-01-12,Loved the smell lasted a week wish they could make one that would last a few wks for the price it smells beautiful tho 💗
5,2022-07-28,"This candle smells soooo good, and lasts forever! Definitely a go-to gift. The scent is light, but not too light. It’s fragrant enough without being overpowering."
5,2021-01-29,Packaging is awesome. Scent is beautiful! Price was spot on! It’s not “soapy” smelling at all!
5,2013-06-24,"I've always loved this product and other scents from this company. But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents. Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles. So, if I would have stayed with what I knew, I wouldn't have had to pay to have my walls cleaned and wasted money on a cheaper product. ""You get what you pay for"" rings loudly for me. Thanks for the excellent product."
5,2022-05-12,No dislikes.The scent in the house is wonderful. Very welcoming to walk into.Yankee candles are a great gift.
5,2021-06-01,I hated yankee candle discontinued Tahitian nights but glad I found it on Amazon. It was a bit pricy but got the exact candle with great scent. It’s also a long lasting burn time. I’ve lit it every day for 3 weeks and still got half
5,2021-07-22,One of my favorite scents is Fresh Cut Roses. The jar comes with a lid (but not boxed) but it would still be giftable (putting in a gift bag w/ tissue).
5,2021-08-18,"Fantastic candle, last so much longer than cheaper ones from other brands. Great scent for year round, summery, and clean but cozy at the same time."
5,2021-11-28,"a lot of the reviews are saying it's not good/fake/came broken but I ordered two large jar lilac candles and they were wrapped HELLA safely and smell amazingggg if u want to get it, get it."
5,2016-03-01,"I burn the Midsummer's Night candle with the Blue Summer Sky candle, on the same end table, next to my ""65"" inch flat screen TV. Away from any return air duct work. The furnace will suck the scents out of the room where the candles are burning, every time your furnace kicks on. Don't forget to trim the wick to 1/16 of an inch before you lite the candles. Tilt your candle horizontal & use a small flame to lite the wick."
5,2022-03-15,This candle smells so amazing !  Wish there was a scratch ‘n sniff.  Makes a wonderful gift
5,2022-06-22,Short and sweet.  The scent is wonderful and the candle is long lasting.
5,2021-08-01,Lovely smell!! Lots of candles these days don’t have much of an aroma I’m finding! But this one.. beautiful aromatic even when not burning. Will def buy again. Recommend highly!!
5,2022-07-30,Love this scent! Great price and burns evenly and for a long time
5,2021-10-06,This scent is amazing so relaxing and rejuvenating..what a deal for a yankee candle Byrne well but I prefer putting it on melter
5,2020-05-02,"This scent, in a small jar form, was included in a 1800 Flowers birthday gift. The theme  - of course - was cut flowers...but the candle scent is more of a constant in my memory than the flowers. (This time!)As a result, I had to order the large jar, it helped with the quarantine too."
5,2021-04-21,The quality of this candle is exceptional. I love the scent as well!
5,2020-12-05,This was on Oprahs best list and it is fantastic.  The scent is wonderful and it fills the whole house.
5,2020-11-18,This candle fills the room with a beautiful rose scent that is not overwhelming. I have medical conditions that cause problems when I’m around heavily scented perfumes and candles but that was perfect.
5,2022-07-28,Yankee candles are great and I highly recommend pink sands!!
5,2021-12-17,Very nice
5,2022-08-01,I enjoy the scent of this candle and will order it again!
5,2020-02-16,My husband got this for me as part of my valentine day gift. I have always loved rose scented items perfumes/candles. This scent smells just like fresh roses the smell is very potent but not overpowering my house smells amazing. Will definitely purchase again!
5,2021-01-03,I LOVE YANKEE CANDLES!  The scent is always strong enough to fill a room and they last as stated.  Especially like the jar candle so you can snuff it out just by putting the lid back on.
5,2022-08-14,Has a beautiful scent. My sons girlfriend really likes it
5,2022-03-03,Received as a gift for Christmas. Smells like a nice beachy clean scent. Fills the home wonderfully.
5,2022-04-29,Pure heaven in a jar. Yankee has captured the essence of my favorite flavor! Harvest is a close second. Those two are absolutely must haves in spring and fall. My sister and I would wait until the first crisp of fall to burn our harvest candles. We marked our holidays with it. The beginning of cold and Halloween and thanksgiving and Christmas
5,2021-07-12,No other brand compares. These last a long time and the wick is long enough. Pink sands is my favorite scent. It wasn’t even lit and I could smell it from afar.
5,2017-06-26,"I love Yankee candles!  I've never been disappointed in any of my purchases from them, and White Gardenia is is no exception.  The fragrance is soft...not over powering but definitely present. I would definitely recommend this fragrance."
5,2021-07-01,"I’m now hooked on the scent of lilacs, and this is the best candle to make a room smell so good. The scent is much stronger than other brands."
5,2017-09-26,The scent of this candle is amazing. It actually smells like roses. There have been times where my boyfriend has lit the candle without me realizing it until I start wondering why our place smells like roses. This particular scent seems to carry well in the area too. I have another Yankee Candle that doesn't fill up the room as much as this one. If you like the smell of roses you should like this candle.
5,2021-04-11,"I loved this candle, it smelled wonderful. Lilacs are one of my favorite flowers because they smell so good.I will definitely buy more of these"
5,2022-03-07,It's a small gift but it makes her happy.Happy wife. Happy life.
5,2021-12-09,Makes a great giftLasts long  150 hoursHas a woderful sentWorth the money.Great quality
5,2021-04-22,I love the scent of lilac’s & this candle did not disappoint. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future!!  Strongly recommend for other lilac lovers.
5,2022-05-22,"It's beautiful and clean looking, I just wish it had more fragrance."
5,2018-04-08,"Love it!  A good burning white gardenia candle is hard to find.  I found lots of them but the ones I found are made withnot so good wax.  Yankee is a bit more expensive but for good reason.  I am a huge believer in ""you get what you pay for.""I highly recommend it and I'll definitely be ordering more!"
5,2022-07-08,My boyfriend loved this it was an Easter basket gift and  a scent from his childhood
5,2021-08-04,I have no problem trusting Yankee Candles.  AND... this Lilac scent has better fragrance throw than other Yankee scents.
5,2022-07-29,Great price for the brand and particular scent.
5,2021-04-06,"I absolutely love the fragrance.  It actually smells just like lilac, and brings back childhood memories.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again."
5,2022-06-30,This candle smells wonderful and it aroma is strong but not too strong.  I definitely will buy this again.
5,2015-07-22,"I went back and forth about whether or not to purchase this, when it suddenly went on sale for 50% off. I said, ""What the heck. If I don't like it, I'll give it away.""I'm happy to say that it now sits in my bathroom, and remains lit whenever I'm puttering about the apartment. It has a lovely scent - true to its name, it smells like fresh cut roses - and it has a great throw."
5,2022-06-10,Awesome price and great smell last a long time
5,2018-09-01,"I love the quality that Yankee candles still produces for their candles, and love the scent - it is very soft, not flowery, just wonderful.  Price on Amazon is better than the sale prices I have seen.  Glad to be able to get it here."
5,2022-03-08,Bought this for my sister in law.  She loved the scent and the Yankee Candle brand.
5,2022-05-03,"I love Yankee candles, no complaints. I would order again and gift!"
5,2021-11-05,Gave it as a gift .. she loved the scent also & the white candle fit into the color theme of her bedroom.
5,2021-05-03,This is another of my favorite scents with this company. It can be a bit powerful but still such a nice sweet and fresh scent to have in the house.
5,2019-06-05,I love Yankee Candles! I think they have the best scents and that actually fill a room with the aroma not like other candles that smell good in the jar but once lit they have no scent. My favorite is Fresh Cut Roses which truly smells like roses! I love my candle but do wish it was more affordable.
5,2021-03-16,"I was wary at first buying a Yankee candle from Amazon.... but it's exactly like buying it from the store! Strong scent, arrived just fine, very happy! :)"
5,2022-02-02,I have been buying Yankee candles for over 20 years they have the very best scents
5,2022-02-21,I absolutely love this candle it is a true lilac scent I would buy this again
5,2020-04-14,"Loved the smell ,it gives my bedroom a fresh air feeling .i have had 3 compliments on it by friends dropping off food during this  Covid 19 period. I have been home 5 weeks now and so much rain I love to light up my candle"
5,2021-08-19,I have always loved Yankee Candles if you watch out you can get a much better price through Amazon than locally
5,2022-05-11,Love this candle the smell reminds me of summer.
5,2022-02-18,I love all the different fragrances.  They make the entire house smell great.
5,2022-04-19,smells more like lilacs than most lilac candles. lovely scent.
5,2022-05-13,Fragrance is a especially nice gift in the Spring/Summer.
5,2015-07-24,"I light this in the living room and I feel like I am sitting next to a honeysuckle! (I know the label is packaged as jasmine, but it smells a little too sweet to be just a normal jasmine.) On a side note, I quote one of my friends ""what, this doesnt smell like jasmine tea at all!"" correct, this smells like jasmine flowers...I love the smell of this candle and burn it quite a bit. The aroma spreads pretty well and the candle seems to be fairly long lasting."
5,2021-08-23,"theres loads of candle companies out there, BUT theres 1 that is head and shoulders above the rest..YANKEE CANDLE!!!"
5,2021-01-13,This is one of my favorite scents for year round that I come back to. It’s very strong and not sure if the most giftable because it is unique. But very sweet + elegant
5,2022-06-26,Candle is urning extremely well and lovely shuttle scent!
5,2022-05-27,I like to burn this for the lovely scent.
5,2020-05-24,"I bought this as a gift and I absolutely LOVE the scent.  Had no idea what it would be like, but I was following a beach themed gift, so I had to purchase it.  I am so glad I did and will purchase another for myself."
5,2021-06-19,I gave my mom this candle for Mother’s Day as a gift. She likes scented candles and the Yankee Candle store. I thought of the Pink Sands from the beach from the calendar.
5,2022-02-26,Wonderful fresh scent that permeates the air! Wonderful scent ❤️
5,2022-05-12,I love the way this smells!  Within minutes the whole room smells like the candle!
5,2020-02-29,"First one arrived completely shattered. I've been hesitant to buy candles online due to them being so fragile. They immediately sent replacement.  I've always loved yankee candle. This scent is amazing.  Soft, sheer, floral scent."
5,2022-08-15,This scent is one of my favorites
5,2022-08-06,"Love the scent, it’s so inviting."
5,2022-08-08,"I love this candle especially on sale. I like to have extras in the house, it’s a great hostess gift"
5,2021-09-17,flowery & spicy scent. I need this while WFH and the days get shorter. Added to my favorites list.
5,2019-05-11,"My new fav scent for Spring/Summer. I was worried it would have a fake, floral smell to it but Yankee Candle captured the aroma of walking through a field of Lilac! This candle will give scent to the entire house but isn’t overwhelming in any way - very clean and fresh! Love, love, love and will buy again!"
5,2020-10-02,"Omg!!! I absolutely love this candle! My apartment smells so good. My apartment has never smelled this cold before. I have two pets and no other candles have helped, this candle is a must have. I have never bought a yankee candle before. Will definitely be trying other scents. Thank you so much!!"
5,2020-11-10,This is the first yankee candle I have ever owned that I could smell all the way through my home.  It smells wonderfully divine.  I would recommend this purchase over and over again.
5,2022-06-26,The scent is fantastic & it has lasted a very long time!
5,2019-09-30,I had no idea what a Yankee candle was and why everyone was freaking out about them. These really DO last forever. I like to burn candles throughout the day and evenings and it's barely made a dent in it. Great candle! Can't wait to try other scents.
5,2021-06-26,This is the best summer fragrance from Yankee Candle! Recently alot of their scents are not strong or long lasting but this one still hits the mark!
5,2016-01-22,"As usual Yankee candles do not fail to deliver on scent and longevity. I have several flower scents (gardenia, and lavender also) in my bedroom and it smells like a flower garden.Additionally, unintentionally, but not unwanted, in the cooler, or colder I should say, three pairs of the large jar candles can warm up a bedroom if it is not enormous. Ours is medium sized, so the warmth is palpable. The lighting is also sublime."
5,2022-07-24,Better price than buying direct. And this is the best all year clean sweet smell
5,2021-12-27,"Was happy to find this scent, it’s a soothing scent of true lilac flowers!"
5,2022-04-15,Absolutely obsessed with the smell. Will repeatedly buy
5,2022-04-22,This candle smells sooooo good and it lasts  longer then the other eh candles out there
5,2022-01-20,This was a gift for a friend for Christmas. I found out that she loved the scent of Lilac's. She loved it!
5,2021-09-17,This candle is the perfect color and the scent is of tangerines and cotton candy.  Just Marvelous.
5,2022-05-03,Smells amazing and last for a very long time.
5,2020-05-09,I love my candles and I love the beach. I put one in my bedroom & one in the living room. Great size and great product for the price.
5,2020-02-08,What else is there to say about Yankee Candle. They don’t have to be reviewed. They are the best in the market without a doubt. You will see this review on three other Scents. Yes I bought three. I love the candle they produce.
5,2018-10-01,I don’t know what’s up with the people who say this has no scent.  I’ve bought several and each has filled the room with a lovely floral scent that’s pleasant without being at all cloying.  I love it.
5,2022-05-13,Love this scent and color of this candle .
5,2022-04-15,Smells exactly like a rose bouquet. Fresh and lovely
5,2021-07-27,Yankee Candles are high quality and the scent of the lilac candle is amazing. The candles make even large rooms smell great.
5,2021-07-14,Smells great! It’s a nice light summery smell. It may be pink but doesn’t scream girl with its scent.
5,2021-06-19,It has a beautiful scent!
5,2022-01-23,These candles smell amazing and I love when Amazon has great deals.
5,2021-07-20,"Love this scent! I bought this on sale recently, otherwise I  think it is overpriced. Lovely scent though."
5,2020-05-04,"This is one of my favorite scented candles. It smells just like suntan lotion, which I love because it reminds me of the beach. It's not too strong or overpowering. Great price for a Yankee Candle."
5,2021-05-27,"My favorite scent scent all year long. In winter it reminds me of summer. In summer, it enhances my poolside margarita"
5,2022-04-26,Beautiful light beachy scent. I love it. ❤
5,2018-10-20,I absolutely love this scent! It is a refreshing and fun scent and it’s so nice to walk into my house and have this aroma fill my room after lighting my candle!I’ve had many compliments from customers and colleagues. I would highly recommend this!
5,2021-03-26,We had to order this twice because the first one came improperly packaged without a box. But the scent is lovely and long-lasting.
5,2022-07-24,A lovely lilac scent.
5,2021-06-24,My mom loves this candle so much better than any other brand. Lilac is her favorite scent and it's hard to find
5,2021-04-12,"I had a lilac tree. This candle smell is perfection.  It is not as overwhelming as the tree was. Highly, highly recommend."
5,2022-08-12,One of the best smell! Very long burnt time.
5,2021-09-20,"i love Yankee candles, i buy them for gifts, everyone enjoys them. Long lasting and the price is the best at Amazon. Also their delivery service is excellent!"
5,2020-07-15,I received my candle and the jar was broken. I Let the company know and they took wonderful care of me. Fast and responsive customer service. I love the scent and the candle is beautiful!!
5,2021-06-11,"This is my mom's favorite scent, and I couldn't find it at Yankee Candle,  so glad Amazon had it in stock.  Best purchase!!!"
5,2019-07-17,"I have ordered this candle twice now for friends who have gotten engaged as part of an ""engagement basket"". Can't weigh in on the scent or longevity, but let's be honest, you're not buying this candle for either of those things. Looks great. Love the aesthetic."
5,2019-04-10,Lilacs are my absolute favorite flower but unfortunately their bloom time is so short. I was leery of ordering a candle on line without smelling it but I am so happy I did!I bought 2 and they smell exactly like the flowers and puts off an amazing amount of scent.
5,2021-02-06,"Its a freaking yankee candle, must I say anymore?? Its so fragrant but not in a chemical way. It truly smells like there is a lilac tree in my house!"
5,2021-05-06,I buy this candle every year and have it sent to my mom because I use to pick lilacs for her as a child and this is the closest thing I can get. I had one show up broken and they immediately replaced it! Love there smell and the customer service!!
5,2021-08-24,"The scent of fresh roses fill the room. As with other Yankee Candles, it's a great value and lasts a long time."
5,2021-02-21,Smells so good! One of my favorite Yankee Candle scents! Smells sweet and slightly fruity but also a bit salty at the same time. Love it!
5,2022-06-10,Love this scent!
5,2020-08-16,I love the smell of lilacs .  I've bought this before and I'm very happy with it.  Is last a couple of weeks but then again I burn it for many hours especially on the weekend.
5,2020-10-22,Has a nice lilac blossom smell and a pretty purple color. Looks the same as in the photos. Plan on giving it as a gift and I'm pretty sure my mom will love it!!
5,2021-04-08,Who doesn’t love the subtle scent of roses. I’ve lit this daily for about a month and still have half a candle. I may need a lifetime supply!
5,2021-09-12,I'll definitely order this scent again. My whole house smells like roses and it's lovely!
5,2019-12-12,"Ordered this candle during the holiday rush, on its way it ended up being a cracked mess. When I reached out, they sent me a new one and have it lit right now!!! This scent is amazing, reminds me of spring as a child."
5,2022-02-04,A nice gift or for a in home SPA day next to the tub.
5,2022-08-17,very nice scent
5,2022-01-07,This smells like the body spray I wore in high school and I absolutely love it.
5,2021-07-21,"My mother loves the scent of gardenias! I got this for her birthday and she was so excited to receive it. Perfect size and lasts a long time, house smells great!"
5,2021-03-25,Great scent. Got it on deal of the day for a great price. Very happy and lasts a long time. Makes my house smells great.
5,2021-02-11,"Only wish it was a soy candle.  This is a great product, packaged well for shipping and gifting, one wick is sufficient for even burn."
5,2022-06-07,Only bad thing was that I bought 3 and was supposed to get other 3 free!! I had a coupon and the site wouldn’t accept it and it was supposed to be good until the date I ordered the candles!!! Very disappointed
5,2012-11-15,"I really enjoy the scent of this candle.  It is not overpowering like some flower scented candles I've tried.  The scent is light and genuinely smells like roses.  I use this candle year round, but especially appreciate it in winter when the windows have to be shut and things get a bit stuffy.  Some strong scents affect my asthma and make my husband stuffed up.  This one doesn't  bother either of us, so if you have allergies like we do it might be worth a try."
5,2022-08-06,Candle smells great
5,2021-10-20,I'm a repeat customer. I love the smell of it and it's long lasting candle
5,2022-07-27,"Smells lovely. A little smaller than I thought, but supposedly has a long burn time. Will purchase again."
5,2020-12-08,This candle has a strong lilac scent that fills a large room and can be smelled from well beyond that room. The color is a vibrant purple. It lasts a long time. I light mine daily for about 1-3hrs at a time and it will likely have a 2 month lifespan by the time it is used up.
5,2022-05-17,El olor es superior agradable

5,2022-06-10,I loved this candle's scent.
5,2022-02-10,Love the smell of Lavender. Not to strong. JUST RIGHT
5,2021-12-19,This is my home scent - light but nice smell
5,2021-01-08,Didn't know if I'd like this one or not so I bought it on the clearance rack. It's not a favourite. Glad I got it half off.
5,2021-06-29,"Smells great, makes a great gift, guild several rooms with scent, lasts a long time"
5,2021-03-23,Sent as a gift for a spring time birthday! Better than sending a bouquet of flowers! Arrived quickly and in perfect shape.
5,2022-01-30,"I have to be honest, I got for a coworker as a gift so I don’t know how it smells… sorry"
5,2021-01-03,Absolutely love Yankee candles and this scent in particular! They last long and really make a whole room smell so much nicer.

5,2021-12-28,"Candle is great, smell is great, size is just ok."
5,2020-11-15,"This is one of my favorite Yankee Candle scents. It reminds me of suntan lotion, sand, and ocean waves. It arrived perfectly intact and ready to go."
5,2020-08-25,Originally this was a housewarming gift. Loved it but hard to find. It's my favorite go-to Yankee Candle when I can find it at a decent price.
5,2022-04-15,"Absolutely my favorite candle!! The smell and the color , i try not to use it because i don't wanna waste it!!!"
5,2018-09-20,"This smells wonderful, like walking through a field of Lilacs.  I can smell it all the way downstairs from my bedroom just by opening and closing the door a few times i'm so obsessed i immediately ordered another one.  Sadly the other candle I ordered arrived with a broken jar so I hope my next one comes unscathed."
5,2020-07-22,I have purchased a TON of candles in my life and it is my GO TO CANDLE. I don’t have one bad thing to say.AMAZING SMELL. GREAT PRICE. Long burning. Authentic.
5,2020-07-16,"I was a little concerned about ordering a glass candle online, fearing that it would come broken but the packaging was impeccable! I’ll definitely order more."
5,2022-01-01,Bought as part of a Secret Santa gift. Wrapped nicely in bubble wrap and had a nice strong smell
5,2021-02-09,"My former roommate used small rose candle in her bathroom often.  She has a keen smell while I don't have any sense of smell.  At this point, I had decided to purchase two jars of them.  Perfect!!!  Sorry I could not answer its scent rating."
5,2021-08-03,I love both vanilla and lavender and together makes a fresheow scent and not flowery!
5,2021-05-12,"Very good fragrant, travels around the entire house. I burned it for about two hours, great"
5,2022-01-29,Yankee candles never disappoint
5,2022-08-10,Like
5,2020-10-11,Smells wonderful! I use an electric candle warmer to extend candle life so I can't speak to its longevity if you actually light the wick.
5,2018-05-25,What can I say...... it’s that time of year...... I love the smell of lilacs...... it’s a yankee candle..... and it don’t get any better than that👍🏼
5,2021-06-05,Really Smells Like Roses... I have several of this scent... Long time YC buyer of many scents...
5,2022-01-02,Does what it says on the label.
5,2021-08-17,"There's not really more to say... Big candle, smells good... What's not to like?"
5,2022-04-27,Used it in bedroom
5,2021-03-10,"Nice, strong scent. I got several weeks of life out of this candle, even lighting it a few hours every day."
5,2022-03-19,Lovel springtime scent
5,2020-10-25,"I love this scent, so fresh and pretty smelling. I was surprised at the great price on Amazon! Definitely had to buy it right away!"
5,2021-05-07,"I love the scent of this candle, everyone who walks in tells me that my home smells wonderful! Incredibly inexpensive as opposed to buying directly from Yankee Candle. Highly recommend."
5,2020-03-11,"When people come in my house, they compliment me on the fragrance. It is really nice. Not too flowery, not too weak. It does last a long time. I have two and I gifted my mother one."
5,2020-11-12,Love the mild/lavender aroma that create perfect atmosphere! This is even good in removing odors in kitchen after cooking!
5,2022-05-24,We love the lilac sent even though it is a bit stronger than some of the other candles. This is a great candle for spring but would also be nice other times of the year
5,2021-08-28,"Very well packaged, very hard to find now it's discontinued"
5,2022-07-15,The Fresh Cut Roses scent lives up to its name. It is like having real roses in your home; it gives you a feeling of elegance and sets the mind to have a particularly special day. You don't have to look for your candle; the scent floats across our 3500 sq. ft. home.
5,2020-06-05,"Exactly as described.  Fast shipment, received in great condition, packaged well.  Great scent was a gift, the person who received this gift loved it."
5,2021-08-30,Like a walk on the beach with soft waves and a cool breeze.

5,2020-07-25,"Love this scent! Been struggling to find a good summertime candle.  This is it!  If you love Yankee’s autumn wreath and pine & balsam scents, then you will love this one too!  Floral but even the boys in our family love the scent."
5,2022-03-19,Love it
5,2021-06-27,This was a mothers day gift from my kids it smells amazing and i love it
5,2020-10-11,No other candle fills the room (actually my entire house) like Yankee CandleLilac Blossom is a nice light scent...
5,2022-06-04,Liked the size and the smell was great.
5,2021-10-28,"Solid jar, fantastic smell, and reasonable price. Overall great. My partner and I love the scent of the Jasmine blossom, and we are pleased with this candle."
5,2021-05-01,"If you love the smell of lilacs, you will love this candle. Like walking into a nice spring garden."
5,2021-02-25,"This is the best gardenia candle ever!! You light the candle close your eyes and it takes you right back to Kailua, Oahu... Mahalo Amazon!! ❤️"
5,2022-05-23,Has a wonderful scent. Would make a great gift
5,2022-02-03,Love this candle
5,2021-03-13,This is my most favorite candle and it has been retired...so finding one was wonderful!!!
5,2021-04-25,I love the smell and it starts when you take off the lid!!!!  Definitely my favorite and will buy again!
5,2021-04-10,"Great candle. Scent is amazing. I'd buy it again for myself, and buy it again for myself."
5,2022-08-02,Makes my room smell like lilac!
5,2022-04-26,Lite potent smell
5,2011-06-15,"I was visiting my mother-in-law and wanted to buy her a gift.  There was a Yankee display and (not lying) this was the last candle I picked up.  Why?  Because it's pink!  Ha!  I fell in love with the smell though!  As a matter of fact, so has everyone else - no kidding.  there has not been one time, either at her house or mine, that when this candle is lit, a woman doesn't comment on how great it smells.  And they always ask what is it, as well as, write it down.  Never before have I had a candle that smelled so good.  Sadly, I have to tell them it is called ""Pink Sands"" (embarrassing!).This product will probably be discontinued once the word spreads."
5,2021-04-16,"I love the scent, its smells so good. I'm always getting comments on it. It last 4-ever."
5,2021-04-17,My favorite scent from Yankee Candle. Just doesn’t fill a room with scent well.
5,2022-05-07,When burning the candle spreads the smell. Really nice especially at spring or if you miss spring.
5,2021-01-11,"This is my favorite scent from Yankee Candle.  It is MUCH CHEAPER to buy it here than on the Y.C. website,"
5,2020-05-16,"I love the scent. Delivery person must have banged it on my porch, breaking jar into hundreds of pieces,I loved the fact that customer service replaced it n two days"
5,2022-08-04,Used for eliminating dog orders. Lasts up to a week or longer… depending on how many dogs one owns.
5,2022-03-11,It’s smells quite lovely.
5,2019-05-15,"I have always loved you and cake candles, and I'm sure you know what this product is and that it will meet your satisfaction. It is up to you to decide whether or not it's worth the cost. I'm satisfied as a customer however!"
5,2020-03-21,Love the smell. Yankee candle needs to start making candle toppers again because you end up with so much black wick and your wax when you get to the bottom of the candle☹️
5,2021-10-25,Smells just like lilacs. My favorite
5,2022-04-19,Perfection
5,2022-03-06,Smells great
5,2021-07-15,I light this upstairs and my whole house smells fantastic!
5,2015-07-03,"I love this candle scent! Its strong, not overly strong, and smells like REAL roses. I am a rose enthusiast and for me personally it reminded me of real rose oils. Particularly picked up the scents of traditional red rose and turkish roses, I love the combination scent! Great service as always from Amazon and Yankee Candle, and arrived in very well protected packaged. 5/5"
5,2022-05-12,Lasts a long time and smells great
5,2021-09-22,Love this candle! Can't buy at Yankee store right now
5,2021-07-16,Omg the smell is in the air reminds me of the shore with the summer breeze coming in.
5,2021-08-13,Love love love these candles and this scent is the best!
5,2021-08-22,I buy a lot of scented candles and this one is probably my favorite.I’ve had it a few months now and it hasn’t run out.  I’ll definitely buy another one when it does run out.
5,2021-10-20,Great smelling candle! Spreads throughout the house.
5,2022-08-16,I like this size and smell. The delivery was fast
5,2022-04-13,It was smaller than expected
5,2022-03-07,Great gift or for your home. You can smell 1 candle burning throughout the first floor
5,2021-10-15,This candle smells great and lasts a long time
5,2020-12-05,Great candle. Started burning the candle as soon as I got it out of the box! It fills the kitchen with a lovely scent.
5,2022-08-03,This is the best candle. I could smell it before I even took it out of the packaging. The smell is strong but not overpowering.
5,2021-09-07,Awesome smelling lilac candle and long lasting.
5,2021-06-04,Closest thing to real lilac fragrance. Definitely worth every penny!
5,2021-01-22,Love this scent my favorite and always makes house smell great! Burns well and lasts a long time depending on how often you light it.
5,2021-11-09,This candle makes my room fragrant but not overpowered.  I love it!
4,2021-08-31,"I'm living at our beach condo this summer, and I burn this candle every day. It's so beachy, and is a little reminiscent of a nice-smelling suntan lotion from days of yore. Used to be that this scent was one of Yankee Candle's stronger ones. Now that most YC's have lost their strong scent (and some of them seem to have no scent at all), at least you can smell this one. But it is very light, so it's great for people like my sister who don't tolerate strongly scented candles. If I could buy the old version though, the more strongly scented one, I would! This one has the same scent, just not as strong.Also, I like that the two-wick tumbler is an option. Used to be it was only the one-wick large jar, the classic Yankee Candle. The two-wick tumbler has a more even burn, and you don't have to burn it for four full hours, as you do with the large one-wick jar, to maintain the integrity of the wax. And no worries about tunneling. So I buy the tumbler version. If I knew I wanted to be at home and burn it for four hours at a time, I'd buy the classic jar version. It lasts longer.PS - I did buy one the jar version of this candle recently, and the scent isn't any stronger than the tumbler version. So the reduced scent of Yankee Candles doesn't seem to have to do with which version you buy large jar or large tumbler. But the smaller of their candles do not seem to have as much scent throw, so I always buy the large ones."
5,2018-03-12,"My favorite yankee candle scent of all time, but doesn’t smell up the room at all. If you like candles with barely any smell, this is for you! Overall though, the scent is soooo yummy! I keep it in my small bedroom for more impact."
5,2021-02-09,Love the scent of this candle.  The candle burns a long time. Well worth the money.
5,2018-02-20,I enjoy the smell of this candle. It is not overpowering (I do wish it was a bit stronger). It is long burning the wax does not​ run out as fast as the cheaper versions from Walmart. I love it. I leave it on all day. Would recommend.
5,2021-02-10,Yummm the smell in the house is so ramantic i will buy lots more highly recommend this candle
5,2019-07-03,The price was only $19.99 which is a good price compared to stores. I can smell it throughout my house when I'm burning it. Another thing I like is that I can leave the house to run an errand and the scent will still be in the air when I get back.
5,2020-12-22,I love this candle.  The scent not only fills the room but last until the next day.  Makes a wonderful gift.
5,2020-03-07,Yankee candles last so much longer than bath and body. This is one of my all time favorites. Half the price of the actual yankee store & are real. Smell amazing.
5,2020-12-29,"This candle has such a beautiful scent. I have ordered quite a few times already. Burns clean, nicely and not too fast. Worth it."
5,2020-10-28,"Love this candle, such a fresh clean scent. Very relaxing. Amazon had such a great price on it, I had to get it!"
5,2012-08-26,"I love this scent! I bought this as a gift to my grandmother, it is her all time favorite scent in the world. She has only had one gardenia candle her whole life and she uses it very sparingly. Anyways, the candle she had is almost out and I was going to buy her the same brand but they sadly discontinued this scent of theirs:( So I went to amazon to look and they didn't have the same brand. I found this one by Yankee Candle and it smells even better! Just opening the jar will fill up your room with the scent for a few minutes. I will continue to buy this one from now on. Thank you amazon for selling this!"
5,2021-05-04,It has a nice through and a fresh clean sent kinda like soap and flowers
5,2021-02-12,Awesome fragrance and the candle last a very long time. I will definitely purchase more. Great price.
5,2021-04-13,Love the scent and color of this candle. The Yankee Candle brand says it all!
5,2022-07-14,"I love Yankee Candles. All of their scents are amazing, and they last a long time"
5,2020-08-08,You can't go wrong with Yankee Candle.  This rose candle has an especially lovely fragrance like smelling a rose from the garden.
5,2021-05-21,Lovely jar candle by Yankee. My favorite fragrance. It did not disappoint!
5,2020-07-14,was lucky enough to get the sale on these cause there my mothers absolute favorite :)smells great leaves the house feeling comfortable
5,2021-07-08,Mush have been hot. It melted during shipment.
5,2020-12-24,Bought it while on sale for my parents.....they love it....and they're picky about scents.
5,2021-07-19,It smeks heavenly for those that love jasmine!!!
5,2021-05-08,"Packaging was good, shipping was fast.Will buy from this Company again.Regards,LGM"
5,2019-08-16,"not as overpowering as some Yankee Candles - nice scent in a long lasting candle, not too sweet like some vanilla candles can be"
5,2022-07-16,Its awesome. My girl loves it.
5,2021-03-22,Bought it for my mom. Her favorite candle scents and she enjoyed it. Would recommend.
5,2021-05-14,Love their scents especially lilac for the spring and summer months
5,2022-05-20,Love Yankee candle 🕯️
5,2021-03-03,The White Gardenia Yankee Candle has a beautiful smell.  I would definitely recommend!
5,2021-07-11,"You spend a bit more on Yankee Candles, but they last longer and are worth it."
5,2022-07-05,Love the fragrance light and breezy
5,2020-05-29,I can’t believe how inexpensive this candle was! The scent is DIVINE - watermelon and summer in a jar! My absolute favorite Yankee Candle scent.
5,2012-06-01,"This candle smells great, and is well-constructed in a thick glass jar with a robust top.  The burn time has been good so far and it's not smoky at all.  It can be a pain to light once the wax wears down, but that's how all ""jar"" candles are I suppose.The smell is fairly mild and pleasant.  It's not offensive like many of the ""fruity"" pungent candles.  This is my second favorite after ""fresh linen."""
5,2021-01-24,"None broke!! Great packaging!! Great smelling, good longevity. I totally recommend for you or as a gift!"
5,2015-05-18,This Yankee Jar Candle is a lot of candle. I purchased this for my wife and she really enjoys it. The fresh cut roses smells exactly as it sounds it would. This thing burns and burns and burns and hardly any has been used up. It's about a year old now and I would say 80% is left unused. She lights it up for about an hour on the weekends.
5,2021-03-29,"Lilac blossoms Yankee candle had a great odor.  It is flowery, and very nice."
5,2019-07-07,"I'm very impressed with this candle, not all Yankee Candle's have this strong of a scent.  This one smells just like roses not too overpowering just very pleasant.  Highly recommend.  I even left it burning all night one night and it still has wax left."
5,2018-11-30,"I love candles, especially Yankee candles. They burn for hours and hours on end and will leave the room smelling fantastic. When my boyfriend forgets to take out the garbage I light these up while I take it out and clean up a little and the garbage smells is gone within 15 minutes."
5,2021-10-29,Love yankee candles
5,2016-06-10,"I absolutely love these ! We had them all spring & several & I ordered more. Great & very strong lilac blossoms scent & very relaxing. Remindsme, where I come from as we got them growing all over place in nature & they smell wonderful ! Great seller, good price, fast delivery. Thank you."
5,2022-02-08,This was a gift to my sis n law who loves candles. The scent was soft floral. It smells so good!
5,2022-05-17,Smells just like lilacs and it is long lasting-well worth the money spent… I will buy more!
5,2021-06-01,Smells really nice yet not overwhelming. Lasts a long time compared to other brand candles.
5,2020-12-28,My DIL loves candles.  She especially loves Yankee Candles for the quality and scent.
5,2021-08-10,A subtle sweet scent with notes of beach air
5,2020-01-29,Bought for my mom as Christmas gift. Wrapped very carefully and I was able to just wrap and give to her. Always smells wonderful and burns clean and even.
5,2021-05-10,I love the smell of jasmine.  This candle's scent is very fragrant.
5,2020-10-27,"Came very surely and well packaged so there were no worries of it breaking in transit. It’s the standard Yankee Candle: great scent, long lasting and a beautiful colour."
5,2021-09-09,Scent is good- lasts a long time
5,2021-03-24,"Love the quality. You can't beat this brand! This Scent i love but isn't strong enough, but the candle last forever."
5,2019-03-03,Pink sands is my favorite scent.  It smells fresh and clean but not overly perfume smelling.  The jar candles seem to last longer than the 2 wick candles.  I'll definitely be ordering more of these Yankee candles.
5,2020-05-11,Really smells like lilacs I love it in my kitchen I had real lilacs in my kitchen when I lived in New York so this takes me back to a time when I had the real lilacs
5,2021-04-10,LOVE yankee candles quality and scents. Pink sands is my all time fave
5,2021-02-16,"Always impressed with how long the Yankee Candles last. The scent if lilacs reminds me of the bush outside my bedroom when growing up. I always keep extras on hand for Birthdays or  ""thinking of you "" gifts. Exceptional quality"
5,2021-01-07,This is one of my favorite Yankee Candle scents!  Like an instant trip to the beach!
5,2018-05-04,A huge candle but packaged well. It has egg crate around the candle and then in a box. The box says what it is but it came in another box with another item. The scent is like a lighter version of Vanilla. I can't describe any other scent associated to it than that.
5,2021-05-14,This is by far one of the best Yankee frangrances. It’s so rich. It fills my apartment. Love it!
5,2022-01-30,I Love the scent of this candle. The scent is really relaxing!
5,2020-09-18,I have insomnia! I light this candle about an hour before retiring. It helps me go to sleep. I find the fragrance to be Absolutely fantastic. I will buy this product over and over again.
5,2021-06-09,Only problem I had was how long it took to deliver.
5,2021-08-21,Long lasting. Quality candle
5,2021-08-04,SMELL'S GOOD AND LAST A LONG TIME
5,2021-07-16,Without a doubt the best candle hands down!
5,2021-07-26,I love this scent! And the price was great too!
5,2021-02-22,I love the smell of Lilac and this candle smells great! Perfect for spring!
5,2021-09-09,I love this candle. It smells so good. Going to buy more for my daughters. Lots of compliments on it.
5,2021-12-28,I did not have coronavirus. Did not lose my sense of smell. The aroma was wonderful and it was strong.
5,2020-08-27,I usually buy these direct from YC but I just wanted one this time so I ordered here. Wowza this smells amazing!
5,2021-03-25,The candle has such a nice  floral scent that travels far.
5,2021-05-07,Love the scent.  Lasts forever.  No way am I giving it away.
5,2021-06-28,"Like a lilac bush in my apartment!Got one for my daughter, too."
5,2017-04-11,"Great scent, good slow burn, wick burns well and doesn't need frequent trimming or do the ""mushroom"" thing where the flame gets huge and the wick gets a heavy head. Fills my home with a warm scent!"
5,2021-02-12,You pay more for these candles but truly worth it and they last a long time
5,2019-12-13,"All I can say is ""I want another one!"" I wish they weren't so high in price. That's the only thing I do not like. It's hard to buy them all the time on a fixed income."
5,2021-04-25,I've purchased twice and will continue to do so.  The color is good and complements my decor and this candle's scent is wonderful.
5,2021-05-23,Smells up the whole house! Wonderful Spring scent...
5,2011-09-16,"I am already a big fan of Yankee candles & think they are far superior over most candles (but even with that being said, they do have a few ""stinkers"" in the bunch). Not Fresh Cut Roses. It is my all time favorite scent they make. It comes the closest to smelling like the real thing than any other rose scented candle I've ever tried. I would say it's a medium scented candle. Not too overpowering & not so weak that you can barely smell it. I highly recommend it!"
5,2022-01-20,"This candle smells wonderful, one of my favorite Yankee candles"
5,2021-04-28,This is a great candle scent! It makes you have dreams of summer!
5,2019-07-30,This is our favorite candle.  We have a cat and it seems to be the only thing that works to hide the fact that we do.  It's on often so a warmer works better cause it burns out fast.
5,2020-04-30,Love this scent!  Some of the Yankee candle scents give me a headache but this one doesn’t.  These jar candles just burn so nicely.
5,2022-04-26,Who doesnt like Yankee candles.  The lavender scent is my favorite so far!
5,2020-09-21,Very strong scent! The price is better on Amazon’s market than buying from the Yankee Candle.
5,2021-07-30,Smells AMAZING!!! Perfect size

5,2021-05-06,"Just perfect! Perfect package, HUGE size and oh so good aroma! Ordered 2 more the same day I received the product!"
5,2021-01-17,The best thing was the SALE price. Wish I would have bought more @ $11
5,2020-01-15,"I bought 2 of these at a reduced price. One of my favorite scents for my bathroom, and the color matches too. Each candle came in it's own box so perfect for gift giving."
5,2020-02-19,"Really pretty scent.  I think it's perfect for a bedroom or bathroom.  Nice throw, especially the large size.  Great price here on Amazon."
5,2019-10-09,Bought this candle as a gift for my friend’s wedding day and it smells SO GOOD. Such a strong nice smell. Yankee candle never fails to do great! Would definitely recommend!
5,2020-11-06,This rose scent is by far the best one they have.  It would be hard to make this one better.
5,2020-06-19,"Wonderful scent, I love rose fragrance, and in just about 15 minutes..the area smells like a room of roses 🌹...love it!"
5,2021-07-31,Yankee Candle never disappoints. Love this fragrance. Smells like real lilacs.
5,2020-07-31,Soft summery scent. Not overpowering .Got for great price.too. Yankee Candles reliably burns a long time too. Would purchase again.
5,2013-08-02,I brought one of these as a gift for my friend about a year ago. I liked it so much I've been buying them ever since for myself. This candle has a light sweet scent that fills my house without being overpowering.Update...I still like this product itself however I will never buy it from Amazon again.  I left package feedback with Amazon as well.  When I got my candle it was open with oil leaking everywhere and the wax was melted and coming out of the jar all on one side.  I live in a hot climate but still if it had been packaged better I wouldn't have been so disappointed but I'm still happy.  I called Amazon and they gave me a full refund so no hard feelings.
5,2021-11-28,It didn’t seem to be as strong a scent as in the past
5,2021-04-14,Love this scent! It is strong and fills the room.
5,2021-12-24,Just gave it to my girlfriend and she loved it
5,2020-02-03,This was packaged very well.  This is a great candle that reminds us of the beach. It’s a soft kind of scent and not overpowering.
5,2020-11-13,We love the mild aroma. It wafts through our home supper soft and is relaxing...
5,2017-05-18,Very pretty! What a surprise when my mom opened this wonderful scented Yankee Candle along with the Gardenia scented Yankee candle that I gave her for Mothers Day! She couldn't be more pleased and happy! She thought they were the best gift ever!
5,2020-08-25,great scent
5,2021-06-20,A little pricey for wax though.
5,2021-01-27,I got it this morning and have going know. It's worth the money.
5,2019-12-31,Came broken- but not your fault. Top of jar was smashed. Lovely smell.Good price. Postal is crazy at Christmas time. U marked fragile.
5,2020-08-24,This candle smells more like oil versus the fragrance. I am greatly disappointed. I have another lemongrass candle by this company and its awesome. I am going to send in back.
5,2020-01-18,OMG what a great product. The smell is so beautiful. Although it is one wick the scent  that it leaves throughout your home is exceptional.
5,2020-04-27,I love this candle. The scent is relaxing and the candle lasts a long time. I have bought a few Yankee Candles from Amazon and I've loved them all.
5,2021-12-25,Love this.  Wonderful scent.

5,2021-05-07,Favorite aroma by far!! Don’t hesitate to try it. Smells like a beach full of luxury flowers 🌸
5,2021-02-05,It’s a little sweet smelling for me. Because of the great price I’d probably still buy it again.
5,2017-12-21,"Better price than the store and always a lovely scent for any time of year except maybe the heartless, disgusting month of February. It's light and sweet and I've found it to be one of the stronger scents."
5,2018-12-31,This is my favorite scent. Smells like real purple lilacs! Great to have because unfortuanately the real lilacs only stay in bloom about a week or so. Now I can enjoy the smell all year long if i want!
5,2020-12-18,I love this candle smell is great quality is great and you can never go wrong with this company

5,2019-02-01,"If you close your eyes while this is lit, it smells just like your in a lush summer rose garden, candle doesn’t smoke, wick is high quality so you’ll get every last hour out of these jars. Yankee is one of the best!"

5,2021-08-20,Smells amazing
5,2020-07-16,Just love this Yankee Candle! Smells like fresh lilacs which is nice after the fresh ones outside are gone!

5,2018-04-19,"Smells great. A little sweet, clean summer scent. I haven't smelled anything else similar. Long burn time and the frangrance feels the room. I watch the Yankee candles for price drops and then order - I find them to be a little pricey."
5,2019-11-24,I just love these candles. I have buying way to many. lol great when they are on sale. Come fast. Thank you and I will be buying more.
5,2013-08-28,"I typically get all my candles from Bath and Body Works and follow all the sales. Jasmine is one of my favorite scents and have been unable to get something with it for a while so I gave this a shot. It's not my favorite combo, but anything with Jasmine in it can never go wrong. Smell is relaxing and definitely can fill a room. I recommend it!"

5,2019-02-03,"Love this scent! It's a light floral lilac smell and it smells very fresh and clean. It is not overwhelming either, as I do not like really strong fragrances. Cheaper here on Amazon than at the store, worth buying on here for sure."
5,2021-07-02,Like but too strong
5,2021-05-24,Smells amazing! Very beachy!!
5,2019-05-19,"Good scent, great price, average throw.  You wont be disappointed if buying this as a cheaper Yankee candle.  Coughing up the full $30 might leave you disappointed though."
5,2017-12-05,This is by far my favorite home fragrance. I love the clean scent and get complimented on the light fragrance all the time. I use the candle in conjunction with the scented beads and electric scented outlets.

5,2016-05-06,Candle smells great and my wife really likes how it makes our bedroom smell at night.  Amazon did a poor job of packing the item though because it arrived broken with glass everywhere.  I didn't want to bother cutting myself trying to send it back so we kept it and are just real careful when lighting it.
5,2020-07-08,Best scent ever. Have it in my home and in my car. Longlasting and always receive compliments!
5,2021-04-17,Love this scent...makes the entire house smell like spring.

5,2021-12-16,Loved the price!
5,2012-10-31,"As a bachelor, I decided it was incumbent upon me to find some nice candles.  As I began my online search (far be it from me to drive to a MALL!) I found one particular brand to be consistently higher priced than the bulk of the others.  As 'Yankee Candle' is a brand name I had heard mentioned by my sisters and daughter-in-law, I finally made the supreme sacrifice of spending more than a dollar for candles. Now I feel like an educated, extremely knowledgeable consumer, with above-average intelligence. Not true, but anyone visiting my home THINKS I'm smarter than the average guy!What a great smell! If you buy this candle, you won't be sorry!"
5,2020-05-05,"This is hands down the best candle I have ever purchased.. The smell is the perfect scent of lavender, honey and the sweetness of the Gelato. The smell dispurses perfectly, not overwhelming or too highly scented. Will be buying more!"
5,2021-05-27,Smells great and burns well.
5,2020-09-30,lasts longer than expected and seems to be a hit with everyone that comes into my office.

5,2019-06-12,"I love Yankee Candles, they are bar far the best I have purchased in many years.  Love the Pink Sands scent. Will be heartbroken when they discontinue it."
5,2014-01-22,"Lilac has always been my favorite fragrance,  When  I learned a new family member also liked lilac I purchased this candle as a Christmas gift for her.  Her eyes lit up as she opened it and smelled it.  She was happy.  Do not know if she has lit it yet but since she has had these before I am sure she will enjoy it when she does burn it."
5,2021-05-08,"Lilac Blossoms has a very clean, pleasant scent.  Not overpowering, just perfect."

5,2013-01-15,"I give this scent a 5 based on the fact that my 85 year old mother LOVES burning this candle. As soon as the one gets low, I order another one. The scent this candle gives off while burning does smell very much like old english roses not cosmetic or chemical like some other brands. As long as mom is happy, this is a regular purchase."

5,2019-11-27,"This candle smells nothing like pink sand... granted, I don’t know what pink sand smells like. I just doubt it smells like this. I’m guessing this candle smells WAY better. So try it out. Don’t sniff the pink sand."

5,2019-02-15,I like this scent but the candle wicks on this particular scent is awful short and burns down faster than  harvest apple and lemon lavendar
5,2022-08-12,Used product it was as ok

5,2019-12-11,It came fast and in perfect condition. The scent is so beautiful! I highly recommend!
5,2014-09-02,This candle smells wonderful – for whatever reason though after about 20 minutes it starts giving me a headache. But since I like it so much I light it for a little while until I start noticing the throbbing in my forehead – it really smells great – I am a glutton for punishment!

5,2012-12-14,I love Yankee candles.  They are the best.  They are worth the price.  Instead of buying my sister flowers I bought this Yankee candle scent of fresh cut roses.

5,2017-05-16,I got this for my Mom who loves the smell of LILACS this really does smell like you have a tree in the living room. You cannot go wrong with candles. Plus it being a Yankee Candle you know the smell is spot on.
5,2020-11-23,Mom loves it.
5,2011-01-11,This reminds me of an old shop I use to go to when I was a kid called the lollipop tree. When you would walk into the store the smell of the candle that this Yankee Candle has is the same exact smell and would always make my mouth water. Get this candle its amazing! Its more fruit and not strong at all.

5,2020-02-15,I like the scent of this candle and the burn life is fairly long.
5,2022-04-23,"What I said in the title, oops"
5,2021-11-10,This candle is great it lasts long but the scent wasn’t as strong as I had hoped so it’s better for smaller areas

5,2021-02-28,Favorite scent!
5,2015-07-31,OMGosh! Fantastic scent before it is even lite. Fills the entire room with blossoming fragrance. It's as if we were back in Northern California with the gardenias right outside our door.  A little overwhelming but I think that's what I like about it.

5,2012-12-12,"Yankee Candle is expensive, and I hesitate to buy it.However, I found that this candle is worth for the money.I like their small. I figure out that the quality of their candle is very good, and that must be how this candle is burning so well even in a such a big glass bottle."

5,2020-01-29,The best smell to me is fresh flowers. That’s what this is like

5,2014-12-31,"It's amazing how this smells exactly like the lilacs that grew in Mom & Dad's backyard. The scent really brings me back to happy summers. It's flowery for sure, but not sickeningly sweet (like some of the other floral and fruit offerings by Yankee). I'd describe it as authentic yet even-toned; maybe even slightly understated. It's kinda like walking by the flowers in a greenhouse or farmer's market on a mildly warm summer day. I wouldn't change the formula at all - it's perfectly balanced. This has been a family staple item for years."
5,2020-10-09,Really the best quality thing! Thank you!

5,2020-06-18,"Lavender/Vanilla is calming and does not have a strong, overpowering smell."

5,2019-12-28,My favorite smell
5,2020-02-09,"These candles smell delicious! I will definitely be purchasing more of these. These candles also lasted a very long time as well. It was very cold outside and I had the fireplace going for two days straight since it was warmer in the living room and I decided to sleep in there. I also lighted the candle too and it burned for two days straight (not recommended). I did not blow it out once. The glass did not get too hot either. I always feel the candle glass when I burn a candle for a long length of time at once due to the fact that I have had them get too hot and break when the candle gets closer to the bottom of the wick. This candle stayed warm and did not get too hot. I was even able to light it for one more evening after I had it burning for 48 hours straight. When I lit it the 2nd time. I went ahead and let it burn down to the wick feeling the glass every now and then to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. It was fine and burned down to the wick like a good candle should do instead of burning less or half of the wax and then the wick is too short to light any longer. I promise that you will get your moneys worth with this candle. The flame is nice and bright and the smell is amazing. I ordered the Pink Sands, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose, and the Honey Clementine. I have not burned the Honey-Clementine candle yet. It's a kitchen candle but I will burn it anywhere. All 3 candles that I had purchased were the larger 22 ounce candles. Thank you! I love these and will definitely buy more soon. These would also be awesome as a gift too. 👍"
5,2018-04-08,"I bought this scent as an air freshener for my car first and fell in love with it! Personally, I think its a very fresh and pleasant scent. Scent will easily fill a decent sized room and the candle lasts quite a while."
5,2018-06-27,My wife loves this scent and the price was fair. It's a Yankee Candle so quality is always great.
5,2017-08-11,"This is my favorite Yankee Candle scent!! Not too strong, but fills my entire house with nice pleasant scent. We have dogs so it really masks pet order!"
5,2021-02-07,My favorite candle ♥️ It’s the best.
5,2021-03-16,I love the strong lilac smell the candle gives off. It makes the whole room smell great.
5,2013-04-25,"Yankee Candles are very (too) expensive in Ecuador so, I decided to purchase one on Amazon.What a dilema!....there are ""too many"" choices...haa haaaI Had the Pinapple Cilantro....wooo[...] smells so yummy that I wanted to eat it.....I had Bahama Breeze ...very nice...and French Vanilla also very nice.So..... I wanted something ""flowerish"" (lol I just invented a word) this time....and finnaly my choice was JASMINE.My choice.......a GOOOOOODDDD choice."
5,2019-10-30,You can never go wrong with Yankee

5,2020-02-11,Mi wife loves it
5,2017-08-17,"So I finally tackled my Keriophobia situation by buying every flavor of Yankee Candle that was included in the special pricing recently.  When they arrived (all different days oddly enough), I opened them all up, took a giant whiff, placed them in a perfect circle, sat in the middle, and then I carefully lit them.  As the wax melted I dipped my finger in each candle and when I felt the pain of the hot wax I yelled ""Keriophobia!""  Terrifying.  But now I am not afraid of candles.  Which will make birthday parties for my kids go a LOT smoother."
5,2019-07-22,Must have if you like the smell of roses.
5,2019-10-16,Best candles Best brand
5,2019-11-01,Love the scent and will get  another one when this one runs out!  Jan  C

5,2019-10-28,Smelled so good!
5,2013-07-29,"It was to remind her of our recent visit and the times she took us to the beach. I sent it via Amazon, so I didn't know how it would smell.  I asked her to be honest, and she remarked that it was a lovely scent,"

1,2019-07-21,"Got this candle at the ""special"" Prime Day ""sale"" price.  I wasn't aware Amazon & Yankee Candles moved out their old or defective merch during Prime Day.  That's the only explanation I can come up with because I have purchased Yankee Candles in the past and was always very happy even though I thought they were a bit pricey.The candle  I  got during the Prime Day Sale gives off less sent than the 3 for 10 bucks candles I got at Menards last Christmas.  No lie.This kinda wrecked shopping on Prime Day for me.  Certainly won't buy another Yankee Candle on Amazon, ever again.  Not really looking forward to the next Prime Day either."

5,2015-04-22,I love this scent. Not overly perfumed or smelly like bathroom spray. This is a classic rose scented candle and it's so calming and I love the soft pink color. One of my all time faves.

5,2019-02-01,everyone’s candle either came melted or broken and i bought FOUR yankee candles and they all came perfect. this candle smells sooooo amazing i lit it in my bedroom while i cleaned my house and came back in and my room smelled so good! it really smells beachy and comforting. i recommend!!!
5,2019-06-30,Loved this scent!  Lasted very long.
5,2019-05-07,Moved to a 2 wick person now
5,2014-02-14,"It has a STRONG sent that fills up my bedroom! some guy complained about it not using up all the wax. that is because the jar is very round and not very tall. You really only want to use this candle if you can let it sit for a couple hours. otherwise it won't use up all the wax and it'll be bad. someone else also complained about the wick. yes, the wick is a little long so the flame is slightly higher than I would prefer, but other than that I don't see any problem with it. I love this candle and use it all the time to give my bedroom a great smell! Great buy! oh and I chose yankee candle because I saw them on Undercover Boss (a cool TV show) and their CEO was such a great guy that I HAD to buy from them ;) The episode is on Netflix if any of you guys want to see."
5,2021-03-09,"My favorite scent, I light it every night."

5,2019-07-30,Great candle
5,2016-10-26,"Love this candle, this is my second time buying it because I love the smell so much. It has a very sweet smell, similar to candy or a jolly rancher but not overwhelming. The jar lasts me about 6 months and that is someone who usually has it lit everyday for about 4-5 hours each day. The candle came nicely bundled in bubble wrap and I didn't find any cracks like some other reviewers mentioned."

5,2021-01-14,Smells wonderful
1,2018-03-21,Smells like the sand. As in not much of a scent. I usually consider Yankee Candle products as candles with strong if unrefined smell. This is not one of them. 4 hours of burning produced nothing but a faint whiff of something that could have been a bathroom air freshener.
5,2018-03-24,We love these candles and fresh cut rose fills up room with scent of fresh roses.
5,2019-05-30,Our favorite candle
5,2019-02-13,"My niece was thrilled, it’s her favorite scent!"

5,2013-02-26,"I ordered this item and sent it directly to the recipient so I was not able to actually see it. However, my Mother In Law who loves Yankee Candles reported that it was FABULOUS!!!"
5,2020-10-10,"Product was packgaged well, so didnt arrive damage. Scent is nice but not strong. Smells very light & clean."
5,2016-04-09,"My favorite Yankee candle fragrance. It's a lovely smell, not overpowering, can be used year round, and a great gift. Highly recommend."

5,2018-12-07,Candle came quick and smellls wonderful
1,2020-08-17,"Not only do they not  hand it to me, they don't even ring the door bell so I know to  look for it.  They put it on the ground which makes it hard for me to pick up.  Then they lie on the  report and say they handed to me.  I don't like that.  This time, they put it in a wagon that I can't even see from my front door without going outside.  That is a far cry from  ""handed to the customer!""  I am handicapped and  just going out the front  door is difficult."
5,2018-08-01,I love this candle and it lasted quite a long time.
5,2020-12-21,Very well packaged so arrives in good condition.

It is large and long lasting, with an attractive color and jar that make it suitable to keep out when not in use. The scent is potent but not overbearing. It quickly fills the area but never becomes too strong. It smells exactly as you would expect it to, like a bouquet of fresh roses."

5,2018-02-12,Nice and smooth!
5,2014-12-08,this is one of my favorite smells I grew up on a farm and we had lilac bushes every where I used to have them all over the house in mason jars.

5,2020-05-03,Love this product! It smells amazing and will fill your entire room. My boyfriend actually thought it was a plug in. The only thing is that it seems to burn rather quickly. Other than that it’s perfect!

5,2017-12-13,Great scant. Bought more
5,2014-01-17,"Every February for the past three years, I have given myself a treat by purchasing Fresh Cut Roses.  The scent is powerful, while still being delicate.  For me, it is the perfect fragrance for the season."

5,2012-04-17,"I love Yankee Candle and wanted to try something different. This is very true, and strong. With that being mentioned, it might be too strong for some. But suited our household fine. It does seem to burn a bit faster that the other scents I've tried, and it smokes a bit. (Even with the wick trimmed and all that). Would buy again."
5,2021-03-11,Smells amazing
5,2021-07-08,I love this candle. The fragrance is old my goodness! All I can smell.
5,2018-08-04,Last a long time and smells great.
5,2017-03-09,"It is a candle. Whether it ""smells nice"" is subjective. It showed up in one piece. It lasted in the noted hour range. It served its purpose in maintaining good vibes and scents in my room . Definitely will buy again.  Disclaimer!!! Be a reasonable person and scent shop in person. I knew what I was buying because I had smelled it before. Don't complain because you were ignorant.  Overall, a very nice candle."

5,2014-05-06,This is my favorite scented candle.  The scent of this brand lasts longer than others do.  The rose scent gives a year-round feel of spring to my home.  I also find this scent hard to find in stores because it sells out quickly.

5,2018-12-16,"I love the smell of fresh roses, i buy them for myself and to gift too my daughter. Although sometimes I've noticed they don't burn evenly. I do wish they were cheaper so I could buy more."

5,2021-12-02,
5,2016-04-21,Pink sands is my favorite smell! My candle came broken but was replaced.
3,2020-04-23,"This is an honest non paid for non free item given review.Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom.The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar.It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience.If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw. This small tumbler just doesn't measure up to the large jar."
5,2017-06-18,"Smells Great, will order more."
5,2015-10-04,My absolute favorite scent. Subtle and calming. And this size lasts foreverrrrr.

The wick burns perfectly and it's very long lasting. Pink sands is my all time favorite and will always be."

1,2020-08-09,"I have been using candles for years. This is the only one that ever made me feel ill if I left it on for more than hour in a room that is about 11 by 12 feet. I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process.However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out.But this candle made it go off every time.Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case.The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did.Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought.But for the price they charge, and given my experience? I can say I personally will never even bother buying such an overhyped object that basically amounts to a some wax, an essential oil and a wick. As well as whatever dyes or chemicals they used to make it so delightfully colorfull."

I like to give this as part of a bridal shower gift with a bottle of wine or just a gift if I am looking a ""little"" something.  The brides love it, it really is a hit, and I think is very apropos."

5,2019-02-05,"First I want to start off by saying I love Yankee candles regardless, they always burn well and give off a nice strong scent. This particular scent is wonderful. I bought this with no option to smell it first and trusted my instincts knowing I've never been disappointed with any Yankee candle I've ever bought. What a pleasant suprise this one was!! I've received many compliments from friends and family who happen to be around while burning it. Also, I feel the decription given on what the blends are for each scent is very accurate.  Which for me helps decide if it's something I'd enjoy:-)"
5,2018-12-05,Perfect condition.
5,2020-01-12,Pretty solid candle

5,2016-12-10,"I love the longevity and quality of Yankee Candles. I particularly like Pink Sands and buy as much of the products offered in that scent as I can. It is strong enough to smell, but otherwise a soft and pretty fragrance for the home. It is not artificial smelling."
5,2015-03-27,Smells sooooo good!  No problems with order or shipping!
5,2019-04-04,Yankee candles are the best

BUT, the candles are wonderful! Arrived in a very protected box and the smell is just divine! Just wish they weren't so expensive or I would've bought a large one."

5,2016-12-14,Wonderful!
1,2020-05-22,"When this candle arrived, I noticed fluid leaking throughout the wax. Looked like the glass jar had been refilled with a homemade wax. The jar broke so I had to put it in a different holder to burn it. The smell is great, but when burning, leaves black soot on EVERYTHING. That is not typical of Yankee Candles I've purchased. The pictures shown are from about an hour and a half of burn. I cleaned the glass and wall and burned it again to see the difference. Sent back the others."
5,2013-04-27,"Nice, non-spicy scent for Spring. Puts me in the mood for the beach with 'new sprouts' and a hint of citrus along with sea air."
5,2015-01-09,"Good smell ,good size"
5,2015-12-11,I totally love this fragrance and will buy it time after time.
5,2019-01-04,I like the awesome scent
5,2017-05-25,Smells wonderful and summer.
5,2019-04-23,Love it
5,2019-02-27,It smells bomb!
5,2015-01-27,for sure
3,2019-03-25,"For the amount of money and reputation of Yankee Candle, I’m slightly disappointed. Fragrance is great as always but it seems that with the tumblr jars, I have issues — the jar candles never give me an problem, but I like the sleek, modern design of the tumblr candles. The wicks do not burn brightly for very long (my photos were taken about fifteen minutes into me lighting them) and they are already going down. By the time half an hour hits, the flames are so tiny, I don’t even know how they manage to stay lit. I mean, you could walk past it in a hurry and they blow out. I guess I’ll stick to jar candles from now on. Great fragrance and design and wax quality, but the wicks are awful. I do keep maintenance on my candles, so I know it’s not me overusing the wick without trimming them. Again, I’ll stick to jar candles. Still believe in the Yankee Candle brand. Hopefully they will be remade."
5,2014-08-15,This was a gift and their response was:  'I love it'!
5,2017-11-21,So love this scent!!!
5,2016-06-30,Excellent item.  Love the fragrance.  Carefully packed this time.
5,2019-03-17,great

5,2015-03-31,:)
5,2019-06-02,my favorite
5,2014-05-30,"I would recommend this source because the product was exactly what it was supposed to be. Quick, I'm pretty sure even less than 48 hours."
5,2016-10-16,I love it!
5,2009-12-11,"I purchased this item for a gift, and I have never seen or received a product so well packaged. I was also notified by e-mail as to when the candle was shipped.  I would not hesitate to buy again from crazycandles. They are great sellers."
5,2018-01-10,Enjoyed it.
5,2014-03-16,"bought this for my sister to burn on her wedding day.  great price, shipped quickly, love it.  can't wait for the big day!"
3,2020-11-02,"I've been buying this candle on and off since 2019, but my last two purchases of this candle, the scent is barely there and underwhelming. Idk what's going on, but I haven't had an adequately perfumed candle in a while. But when you get a non-dud, the smell is so calming and it lasts for a very long time. Good luck"
5,2018-09-02,Good quality
5,2014-09-10,Love this product. The fragrance is just heavenly.
5,2017-10-31,I love Yankee Candle large jars because they last so long and there is no danger of fire. They make the whole house smell so wonderful! Buy any one of their scents. You won’t regret it!
5,2018-05-12,Great clean smell for the home .
5,2018-03-08,"Love candles, and this is one of my favorites."

5,2013-10-24,Got this as a gift for a friend. Awesome price compared to in store prices of these candels. She Loved it.
5,2012-04-14,"I love my candle, and use it all the time when I'm studying.  It is such a relaxing scent, and have already suggested it to friends."
5,2017-12-02,Used it few times already. Very pleasant smell.
5,2017-05-23,very goood :)
5,2015-06-01,"It's a Yankee Candle, of course it's perfect."

5,2017-12-09,I’m so excited about this candle not only because it smells amazing which ironic because hate roses lol but I am in love with scent. It makes the whole house smell amazing and I got it for great price!!!
5,2016-03-06,Perfect present for my wife.
5,2014-01-22,My girlfriend told me a while back she liked this type of candle so I ordered this one and she loves it.
5,2015-02-01,I knocked my Mom's Birthday out of the water with her favorite candle ever; Yankee Candle - Freshly Cut Roses.
5,2018-10-19,Very useful.
5,2017-08-08,"Yo, this smells bomb. Probably my favorite summer candle to burn, but I burn it all year round. I'm super into lighting Yankee candles all over my house like a weird old cat lady, but this one is by far my fave."
5,2017-05-01,Exactly what I was hoping for!
5,2016-03-18,GOOD!!
5,2018-08-13,my favorite smell!
5,2021-11-05,"I just bought this to put in a gift basket for my sister-in-law who is doing a beach theme in her bathroom in her new apartment. I had no idea what this particular scent smelled like. I've bought several Yankee Candles before, but have never smelled this one so I had to go off the reviews and chance it, and I'm so glad I went with it!! It smells incredibly GOOD and goes with her beach theme!"
5,2018-01-25,I love Yankee candles love this sent was awesome.
5,2017-01-07,I really liked this product.
5,2018-07-13,It’s so fast!Thank you.
5,2014-04-28,Recommend for anyone that likes the smell of lilacs.Yankee Candles are the best scented candles I haveever used.
5,2014-12-10,love it
5,2014-08-21,Subtle but wonderful.  Very satisfied.
5,2018-05-14,Awesome and long lasting
5,2015-01-05,gave it as a gift. very pleased with it
5,2016-11-10,Wonderfully scented candle.
5,2017-10-24,Same review as Strawberry Lemon Ice.
5,2015-01-22,The relaxing smell sets the mood in an average sized room and is not overwhelming.
5,2013-04-27,"They wern't broken this time, securing the covers on did the trick.The scent is great.  Thank You,  Mary A. Schnopp"
5,2016-10-11,"I love the candle but when it arrived the jar was broke into many pieces,"
5,2015-04-16,"Candle smells great, had my neighbor compliment my apt. Fresh cut roses smells like a clean garden."
5,2016-06-21,Absolutely  Love it.
5,2015-10-21,"Slow burn, smell great, love it"
5,2014-05-15,"I love my new candle, great scent and I appreciate the free gift!! thank you, will be a return customer for sure"
5,2014-07-26,awesome smell
5,2014-02-15,I thought that this was a really cute bridal shower present for a couple that already had most of what they needed. It smells really good and most women love a Yankee Candle!
5,2014-11-08,I love this scent!  Arrived on time and in tack... Thank you :)
5,2015-08-26,Can't get enough of the smell!
5,2015-05-25,"Love, love, love Yankee Candle, I want more & more, and more!"
5,2015-12-06,Awesome. Scent is Fresh roses and not too strong just right. Love it and very please with this scent.
5,2022-02-23,"Mahalo nui loa Yankee Candles.... I light this every single day and buy one after another; perhaps 2 per month.  I miss my home in Hawai'i Nei so much, but this aroma is perfectly scented.  So many neighbors compliment me as I live in a senior residence near Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  'Olu'olu (please) continue making this 2 wick candle for all of our islanders.Me ke aloha pumehana, Dr. Karyn Kaonohi'kahikino'okala Spencer"
5,2012-07-11,"If you love the smell of Night Jasmine in the spring, this candle is for you.This candle gives off a strong scent even when it's not lit, but it does not overpower your senses.Once you light the candle the room explodes with the floral elegance of the plant.  Absolutely love this scent.I would not recommend putting this in a 10x10 or smaller space, like a small office or bathroom.  I think it would be sensory overload.  Again, this is a dominate smell, unlike some yankee candles that have more undertones and have a earthy base.  This candle will fill a room fast of pure floral scent.If you do not like floral smells this is not the candle for you.I absolutely love it, but I know there are many who would not appreciate the ""bang ya over the head with a bat"" (but with flowers) when its lit.*WARNING:  If it's really really hot out (90-100) WAIT TO ORDER.My first candle melted during shipping.  SO I went to the store to purchase it again."
5,2022-04-28,I am a huge fan of rose I use almost anything I can rose scented. I decided to buy this candle based on reviews and Omg it’s no joke it literally smells like a fresh bouquet! It’s better then wax melts. I’m super satisfied and it definitely worth the money in my opinion.
5,2020-05-30,Love Yankee candles BUT this one came damaged. Fortunately I had an empty Yankee candle jar handy and a spare wick on hand so rather than return it I remelted the candle and poured it into the new jar. I didn’t want to waste what was otherwise a perfectly good candle.Word to the packers: please do better when packing glass items.
5,2022-04-29,Great scent from Yankee Candle.  I will buy this until they stop making the scent.  At first I wasn't sure about the idea of Lavender Vanilla but once I got the chance to try it I was hooked.Price is good.2 wicks really helps bring up the scent quickly.
5,2016-12-04,"Love this scent , scent stay in the room"
5,2017-08-13,Great product
5,2015-03-18,Great
5,2015-02-20,came perfect and packaging was awesome. happy
5,2016-08-24,Smells sooo good!
5,2016-03-08,Smells great and very high quality. Was a christmas gift and it has a great scent to it.
5,2016-02-07,"Choosing this candle was intentional because of it's name knowing the excellent quality, the wonderful scent and it's long lasting burning. This is a candle that is exceptional."
5,2018-01-29,"As long as you dump out the watery wax after each use it burns perfectly until you reach 1/2,the limit when you should discard it,it also smells very nice"
5,2017-08-27,wonderful.  I don't even have to light it.  Just take the top off and it fills the room with fragrance.
5,2015-06-05,"Beautiful scent, LOVE"
5,2015-07-02,great
1,2019-06-27,"I ordered a Yankee candle last winter. It was the best scent and longest lasting candle Ive ever had. I was so excited to get my next one but it came, altho well packaged, totally broken. I sent it back and got a replacement. Also totally broken. Broken glass pieces fell everywhere when I opened the package. A piece of glass actually cut me. Not just big pieces, but tiny ones too. It was a mess to clean up.  They both smelled delicious even through the packaging. What a bummer."
5,2015-11-23,Yankee candles are wonderful- and this scent is amazing!
1,2021-02-07,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 This was a gift and it was unusable as you can see the candles had somehow melted and were mishaped."
5,2017-08-30,"It's wonderful to get one of my favorite scented Yankee candle at a lower price, thank you!"
5,2016-03-14,It smells really great!
5,2016-05-01,Perfect
5,2014-09-04,Love it
5,2020-02-12,"I was surprised when I received this candle that it not only had a dominant note of beautiful rose , but it was layered and accentuated by almost a crisp pear note, and a few more that I can’t quite name but enhance the rose smell so much. It is much fresher and nuanced than expected, certainly not your grandmother’s cloying rose scent :-) can’t say much for longevity since I just got it today, but if you’re a fan of rose, perfume-type scents, and fresh/fruity/floral, you’ll love this little candle."
5,2016-10-09,"Lovely, natural scent. Not overwhelming or fake smelling. Very nice."
5,2016-07-30,"Nice, fresh "" sunshine"" scent!"
5,2018-01-22,Yankee Candles have an incredible fragrance just sitting thereand when lit perfect.
1,2021-02-09,"This is the awfulest smelling candle I have ever purchased.  It smells like weeds or grass burning.  I just can't describe it.  No where near the smell of lavender.  Made my whole downstairs stink.  Lavender should smell beautiful and relaxing, not smell awful like burning grass.  Don't waste your money on this one."
5,2018-06-05,Mother in law loves this candle. I prefer Village Candles- longer burn and better smell.
2,2020-08-19,I thought if I got an expensive Yankee candle I would have my room smelling better it did not I took it to the kitchen thinking if I light it in there it would smell different it did not I took it to a small bathroom and you sit in there to see if I can get some kind of smell out of it I did not I will not purchase This again and waste my money
5,2015-08-11,Love love love this scent!
5,2014-07-01,Mom Loved it!
5,2017-03-30,Smells YUMMY!!! my new fav!!! perfect for spring/summer!!
5,2019-01-28,"These candles last LONG! Most of the time, my favorite scents are not available through the official Yankee Candle store, so I head over here to find them! This candle packs a very fresh, vibrant scent of roses - as if they are right under your nose!! The wax is of such high quality that it burns a VERY long time, but in my experience, the Large classic jars last longer than the Tumblers. I have a rotation of scents I like in my room, and this amazing one is definitely in there."
5,2015-01-03,Great
4,2021-02-20,"I bought the pink sands scent - it literally smells like starburst candy, kindof like the strawberry and watermelon flavors mixed together - definitely a very unique and pleasant scent. The smell is not terribly strong but also not necessarily weak, I imagine this would be a good choice for someone who likes fruity smells that aren't too overpowering. I gave this candle four stars instead of five because I was expecting a different (and admittedly stronger) smell but otherwise It is really a great candle. Just remember to always trim the wick before using it again because the wick starts to form black bulbs that fall off if you have the candle on after a while and you don't want these falling into the wax."
5,2020-12-10,"At first I didn't like the smell as it smelled a bit cheap but after a few days it became pleasant ! It would make a great gift or make any room cozy. I don't light it, only open the lid and that's good enough for me. A bit expensive but I think it'll last many years as i don't plan on lighting it anytime soon"
1,2020-08-30,"I don't know why so many reviewrs said that the scent was great because both tumblers, rose and lavendar/vanilla did not have a scent before lighting and no scent after lighting. I uesd to buy ONLY Yankee Candles because I thought I was guaranteed a beautifully strong scent but not in the tumbler size for some unknown reason"
5,2017-08-24,"I absolutely love Yankee candle!  This was a very good price and I love the scent.  I bought lavender because I read the scent can help with feeling calm and is good for around bed time.  I have a teen just starting high school who not only needs to be at the bus stop at 6:30am, but often has trouble going to sleep.  He actually lights this nightly and whether it truly works (lavender is known for this effect) or he just enjoys it, either way we love it."
4,2020-11-09,"Candles a little expensive than I like to see but that’s just the brand, only issue I had was it came melted on the top. Had to submit for a second one, but Amazon was great it replacing it quickly the timing just missed the birthday party. My mother in law was still happy since it’s her favorite scent."
3,2022-06-07,I have bought Yankee candles for years because the scent is usually strong enough to scent the whole house... not this one. First it was 3 days late getting to me and the box it was in was beat up but the candle itself wasn't damage. When I took the top off I noticed that I didn't get the usual burst of scent. I also noticed the unusual striations of the candle itself but didn't think anything about it. After lighting it and noticing that you could barely smell the scent and then thinking about the striations I think the candle is one that's been sitting for a long time somewhere and has lost its strength. I had been looking forward to the candle so I am  disappointed. Shame on Yankee candle /Amazon for selling a product that isn't 100%.
5,2017-06-29,I love the smell of fresh cut roses
5,2014-09-23,Good
5,2021-02-25,"I have burned this candle twice and I can tell it’s going to last forever! A great bargain, I’m so tired of candles you have to selectively burn if you want them to last a while. I like to use this at night when I’m getting ready for bed/before sleep as some pleasant aromatherapy."
5,2020-05-18,Lavender is my favorite scent for my bathrooms. They smell like bath soap and are not overpowering. This scent is impossible to find at the Yankee candle stores although the clerks tell me everyone e asks for them.
1,2021-04-12,"Not sure what I thought ""wedding day"" would smell like but this smells like a cheap dollar store candle. Nothing special about it. I plan on returning and making my own label to put on a more pleasant smelling candle that cost less"
5,2018-01-21,Product was as described and arrived on time.
5,2018-04-12,"by far my favorite candle scent. burns forever, especially if you freeze it first"
4,2019-01-08,"I really enjoyed using this candle. I burned it for a couple of hours every night until it burned out. It didn't quite smell like lavender as I know it, however. It had more of a pine smell to me. It was still very nice, but not exactly what kind of smell I was looking for. I would still recommend it if you're not dead set on a 100% lavender-smelling candle and just looking for something relaxing."
5,2016-07-26,good
5,2022-05-14,"I bought this for my daughter, she loves the beach. She said after opening this that it smelled like suntan lotion and reminded her of the beach."
5,2020-12-13,Love this scent!!! It's literally the next best thing to having your home filled with bunches of real fresh cut roses!!! Easily an all time favorite candle!!!• Beautiful Scent• Great Throw• Pools Evenly• Long Lasting Slow Burn
1,2022-05-08,Love the scent. This candle came without a lid and was damage. Contacted seller about it with no response.
5,2012-09-25,"I bought this candle in a smaller size for my mother for Mother's Day and she loves it! She doesn't even have to light it, because the breeze in her room blows the scent all throughout.I loved the scent so much that I bought myself this large jar. I lit it every day for at least three hours in my room and it has lasted for months. I bought another one when it was on sale in stores and I also bought this scent for my boyfriend. He doesn't like girly scents, but he loves this candle. If you hold this jar open next to a honeysuckle vine, you won't be able to tell the difference between the two.Recommend to anyone who even remotely enjoys the scent of honeysuckle. I think it also smells similar to my angel trumpet vine when it blossoms in the evening."
5,2017-07-13,great candles
5,2017-08-24,"Ordered as gift for a friend. I decided to order the most rated candle, because i had no idea what any of the scents smelled like. Great choice. Smells sweet but not over powering."
5,2017-08-27,Love Yankee Candles.
5,2017-09-07,what I expected
5,2013-04-19,"Yankee Candle has tried on a couple attempts to make a ""grass"" candle. I've tried them all. The last was Dune Grass which was alright. I recently purchased Riding Mower. I think it's part of the ""man candles"" collection. There's ""2X4"" which I hated and ""Man Town"" and ""First Down"". I haven't tried the last two but they got it right with ""Riding Mower"". I love this candle! It does smell like I just cut the grass. If you like the smell of fresh cut grass but have allergies, this may be a good way to get that smell without watery eyes."
5,2015-09-19,Love this scent
5,2022-05-30,"I absolutely love this candle, perfect for summer. I love the glass jar as well. Perfect candle"
3,2020-07-25,"I have been looking for a candle that smells like SPF (that might sound weird to you, but I don't care, I love the smell of SPF). I bought this candle because someone mentioned that it smelled like sunscreen, but after purchasing it and lighting it for several hours, I would like to report that this candle does not smell anything like sunscreen. There's nothing wrong with the scent, I'm sure people who are just looking for a light, summery fragrance will find it very pleasing. But, I was hoping for a smell that reminded me of sunscreen."
5,2017-07-16,Very pretty smelling.
4,2022-04-19,So I love candles and I had a yankee candle I purchased a while ago that I loved so I thought I would super happy with this purchase…unfortunately that’s not the case the candle smell great before it’s lit but the scent does not spread threw out my house like my previous yankee candle so I won’t purchase again for myself but someone else if they like yankee candles.
1,2022-06-12,Smelled nice. Never smelled like anything once actually used. Tossed it in the trash
5,2020-10-21,"Scent is not too strong for those sensitive to smells. However it does smell great and I wish the smell was stronger! It takes a while for an entire living room in an apartment to smell like the candle scent, so this may be perfect for those who dislikes strong scents"
1,2020-06-09,"I used to love Yankee Candles and bought them regularly because of their wonderful scent. I could smell them all over my house when I burned one.  However, over the past couple of years they have changed their formula and you can barely smell anything.  Regrettably, this was the case with this candle.  Unless you're standing right next to it you will not be able to discern any measurably throw in your area.  Not worth the money and I will, sadly, not buy any of their candles again."
5,2017-07-21,Excellent!
4,2022-05-21,Not really worth the money there are better smelling ones these burn way too fast
1,2020-12-25,"I love yankee candles , my house is filled with candles, I NEVER experience any problems with them until now.  I was ready to light my gorgeous lavender candle and guess what no WICK.  I tried to dig a little, but there is no WICKPLEASE send me a replacement ASAP"
5,2018-06-16,The true rose smell from Yankee Candle is a household wide loved scent! These wax melts fully embody that scent and smell even better than the wick burning candle as they are muddled with a burning smell as well. I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves the smell of roses as it is the closest to a real red rose that I have ever found and Yankee Candle is very reliable.
5,2021-05-14,"Candles seem to have been stored well; packaging all paper materials. Love love love Yankee Lavender scent. Haven't been able to find on Yankee site, so thank you Amazon!"
3,2010-10-05,"I am very picky about my lavender products... always looking for things that contain pure essential oils of lavender.  I even grow three different species of lavender...so I think I know what lavender smells like.Yankee candles are among my favorites for quality candles in a huge variety of scents.  They burn evenly and cleanly.  I was excited to try their lavender candle.However, this is not lavender.  The lavender and vanilla candle by Yankee has more lavender than this... and even then that candle is vanilla dominant. This candle is very floral... reminds me of a flowery soap that was lavender colored and trying to be 'lavender'.  It smells good... it smells clean... it smells feminine... and it is yankee quality... but I am sorry, this isn't lavender."
2,2021-01-08,The first candle was used. The lavender scent is very light and barely detectable. Very disappointed.I also ordered a vanilla candle 2 weeks ago. It still hasn’t arrived..
4,2021-03-31,Only thing I didn’t like got price you can’t get the wick cut like you do in the store’s it makes difference however you can buy ur own cutter from Yankee candle store’s!
2,2022-07-19,"Looks like the inner wall cracked so it melted into the second layer making this splotch, not sure if I should use it."
5,2019-10-26,I've been looking everywhere for this candle and found out that it has a different name in the European market.If they ever stop making this I'll be so sad.Smell seems to be less intense as before and wish it was stronger.Still my favorite candle ever.
1,2018-11-04,Products shipped and no wick is visible. Looked like it was shipped like this.  Shipped in 40 degree Ohio weather- cap has no signs of melted wax either.
5,2020-10-23,"I love this candle. I Always enjoy the different scents especially when I match it with the seasons. It also lasts very long at least to my standards. It’s very giftable; sent one to my aunt, cousin and grandma. I always end up receiving positive remarks. I The only thing I don’t like about it is the price. So I buy many when it goes on sale."
2,2022-01-12,This doesn’t smell like my previous Yankee Candle with this name and it doesn’t spread scent throughout the room at all. I can’t even smell it when it’s burning.
3,2018-05-11,"Originally, I rated 5 because it was a good price and size for a bedside end table. And the candle smelled great! I don’t usually care for the smell of lavender. But this candle is mixed with honey and gelato, and smells fantastic.Unfortunately, every time I light it, it would become crackly and smoky. None of my other candles do that. So I had to stop using it in case I fall asleep and something happens. I’m not sure if they can change an ingredient to prevent this? I really like the scent."
3,2021-09-09,The fragrance isn’t strong like a usual Yankee candle is. I did like the smell but it was also about three or 4 feet away from me I couldn’t smell it with my bedroom door open in my living room which the couch is about 3 feet off the bedroom.
5,2022-05-09,I liked how it smelled. It would make a wonderful gift.
3,2016-10-08,"The candle itself smells great, but for the love of all that is holy make sure they don't ship it to you through FedEx! If they do  cancel your order and then re-order it and try to make it so it ships through UPS.My candle arrived half melted with the wax covering everything else that was in the box including the presents for my mom and sister."
1,2020-04-18,This candle has no scent.  I bought the candle because Yankee Candles are normally very good. I wanted a lavender scented candle and all I got was a purple candle in Yankee Candle jar.I do not recommend buying this scent.
5,2022-03-30,"Lavender is my favorite Yankee Candle scent but it’s unfortunately been discontinued. I was thrilled to find one available on Amazon, at a reasonable price. It shipped fast, wasn’t a fake, and my house smells sooo good right now. I only hope I can find another when this one is finished!"
1,2020-02-02,Don't expect this to give of a noticeable scent.I suppose if you risk burning your nose hairs you could notice an odor.I regret not sending them back immediately..they ain't cheap and it hurts my wallet every time I look at them.
5,2020-07-09,Bought for a nurse who cared for me and she LOVED IT.  Gave me a hug.  She said it smelled wonderful and was her favorite color too.  I owe her more than a candle in so many ways.  Nurses are angels..
2,2020-11-07,This doesn’t have a very good lavender scent. It doesn’t smell like lavender
5,2021-04-21,I love this scent! It truly reminds me of being at the beach.  This is a great gift for a friend or for yourself! Highly recommend!
5,2019-07-06,"This is my second time buying this scent. I love yankee Candles in general, they are high quality. You definitely get what you pay for. Midnight Jasmine is a lovely scent, it does not smell exactly like night blooming jasmine, but very very nice, no complaints at all."
3,2020-06-02,"I’ve ordered this item before (not through amazon) and loved it, but the item I received doesn’t give off a particular scent unless you’re standing right by it. Unlike most yankee candles, which scents envelope the room. I might have gotten a dud or an old item. Won’t be ordering here again"
5,2014-01-19,I love Yankee candles! They smell delightful. Very good option for gift giving for the holidays. Yep yep yep yep.
5,2018-11-20,"I've bought a few Yankee Candles before and have been dissapointed because of their lack of smell . BUT this was not the case for this one. I love this candle , because it really does smell great and seems to help get's any pet odors out of my basement. Will continue to purchase in the future."
1,2021-10-10,"Candle didn't smell at all like a jasmine,  the scent it had went away quickly. Very disappointed"
5,2019-02-22,"Great color and fragrance....burns good (love candles that liquify and not burn down the center).  Yankee Candles 2 wick soy wax tumblers are the best in my opinion.  I make candles so I am very particular about the quality and these are the best, and I've tried them all!! lol"
1,2019-08-14,"This doesn’t really have a scent other than the warm wax scent you could get from a basic, unscented white candle. The unlit candle had a very light scent that really was kind of a non-specific sweet smell. Serious waste of money."
5,2010-04-16,"The scent of Lavender is noted for it's calming properties. I truly enjoy the aroma of this scented candle and Yankee Candle, in my opinion, is the best. The jar never gets hot and putting the cap in place while the wick is still lit is a convenient way to extinguish the flame without the smokey smell one gets when a candle is simply blown out.  I have tried numerous other lavender candles and none have been as fragrant or satisfying as Yankee Candle."
3,2022-04-10,Would like stronger scent
2,2017-05-29,"Unfortunately, unlike other reviewers, I didn't like this scent. It didn't remind me of beach or vacation, just smelled harsh and chemically. On top of that, there was black smoke coming out of the flame pretty frequently. Not sure if I got a fake. Can't imagine myself buying this again, as I can't see how this is appropriate for any room in my house."
1,2022-08-08,I would love to get a replacement for this candle. It’s beautiful and smells amazing. It would definitely make a great gift.
4,2013-02-19,"Next to Yankee's discontinued Salt Mist Rose, this is my favorite rose fragrance. Light yet lasting, and somehow fresh-smelling. The only problems with ANY of my recent Yankee candles have been with the wicks. Has Yankee changed their wick? The candles burn about halfway and then the wicks get horribly carbonized and start sending out black soot. I trim my wicks with regularity, but somehow they always end up a mess. This never used to happen with Yankee."
1,2021-11-20,This was a gift from me for my daughter. She chose and was really looking forward to receiving Pink Sands. She cannot tell you whether she likes it’s scent or longevity. The box said Pink Sands. But… inside was Apple Pumpkin! This and another candle from a different supplier was the first time I have ordered on Amazon. Not a great start!
2,2021-04-19,"Smelled great in jar! Unfortunately, once lit, it lost it's scent. Too bad because I loved the scent."
2,2020-10-05,"I had such high hopes knowing that it was a Yankee Candle, but was sorely disappointed that the scent wasn't strong enough to fill a 10x15 room"
5,2021-12-06,Good for making the room smell that much better
5,2017-05-26,Always been a big fan of the smell of cut grass. This candle nails it perfectly. It gives off that scent just enough it without it being overbearing. It really does smell like someone just mowed the lawn outside after this candle has been burning for a bit.
5,2022-04-08,I love this scent it smells like a bouquet of flowers and it was packaged very well.
1,2020-04-11,All yankee candles have lost what made them number one decades ago... their scent. I can burn them in a small room and barely smell what ever scent their supposed to be. Finally got a wif of this one bending down to blow it out. Its such a shame how consumers are duped and used by companies who get famous then reduce their product quality. You can see how much less the scent oils are used in these candles through the glass.Don’t know why I spend money on Yankee candles anymore?!
3,2018-03-06,"I love the smell from the jar, but it doesn’t have a very good throw (wafting radius) compared to other scents I’ve bought from Yankee. Which is disappointing because I *really* like this scent! I just wish it would fill up the room the way other scents do."
5,2019-08-15,"I love rose and other floral scents. This candle has a moderate strength scent; not enough to potently fill up a large room, but not too subtle either. So far it seems to burn at a good rate and evenly. Happy with this buy."
5,2021-08-18,Just in love with this product. Will be buying this from now on.
4,2016-07-20,"I was very hesitant to buy Yankee candles despite the fame. The main reason is the 90s looking packaging, which evokes mental associations with artificial, cheap, plasticky and chemical fragrance. I'm not of a New Age anti science type, and I understand everything contains chemicals, and what H2O means. I acknowledge that some greatest perfumes contain synthesized compounds, and they smell great. However, you know some candles with cheap artificial fragrance just give you headache and only make the space smell repulsive. Unfortunately, many of those have the look of this packaging, especially the dyed wax. Dyed wax is just so off-putting... But compared to the high end candles, this one is a great deal if you are aware of how big it is. So I set my ""bias"" aside and got it. Well, it actually smells great! Not a trace of offensive grocery store air freshener scent! Maybe it doesn't smell like real lavender, but that's expected. It's processed natural fragrance, you can't expect it to smell like the plant itself. But again it smells unmistakably lavender, very soothing. I guess I can bear with the look now. Actually some people might find this packaging nostalgic and authentic to the brand, I sincerely hope they would offer the same great scent in some more updated and modern packaging."
5,2013-08-20,"I gifted this candle to my sister for her birthday in June.  I imagined her lighting it on her patio at night, enjoying the fragrance of jasmine. This is exactly how she enjoys this candle. She loves the scent. She is still enjoying it in August. Yankee candles are the most fragrant, however, in my opinion, expensive.  Hoping that someone gifts me one of these lovely candles.  Perfect candle gift."
1,2019-05-12,"I couldn’t smell anything, I let it burn for an hour, nothing. Getting up close, nothing. As far as longevity, after an hour I gave up, that’s unknown. Could be giftable but know for me there was no lavender smell."
2,2020-04-30,"This was great for the first few uses or so. Good smell, very relaxing. Then it just absolutely refused to light.I tried digging the wick out to expose more of it and it just burned down. I even tried using a blowtorch on it, which got the candle to light for about 30 seconds, during which time it's spark like a firework (see video). Subsequent attempts to relight it with the blowtorch also ended in failure. Damn thing just won't burn."
1,2020-06-05,"I swear, I am never paying more than $5 for a jar candle again. A $1.49 unscented Virgin of Guadalupe candle from the supermarket will work just as well as this *thirty-dollar* candle in the bathroom. And it will smell just as much like roses! Well, okay, once I caught a slight whiff of roses when the Yankee Candle was lit today, but the price per whiff is outrageous. I can soak off the labels of candles from the supermarket and save a bundle.  (Shorties votives actually *do* smell like roses, but I'm having a hard time justifying the expense of their jar candles.)"
5,2018-02-03,I didn't like how the first delivery was packaged and one of the candles shattered with glass bits everywhere.  I wish you carried the large size also.  The second delivery was much better and I am enjoying the candle scent. Thank you!  Joe
5,2016-07-18,"This is a fantastic summer fragrance and the closest thing I've found to the scents of the beach. It's too bad Yankee Candle doesn't make their fragrances in incense, which lasts longer and provides more fragrance."
5,2020-10-19,First candle came had the top snapped off around the glass and broke a bunch of it.  this replacement was immediatly shipped and arrived in great condition
5,2020-10-21,Yankee Candles never disappoint. Make sure to keep the wick short so they don't smoke. Love these candles
5,2021-01-13,Candle is long lasting. Right volume of scent during the burn cycle. Will continue to purchase.
5,2019-12-27,"I have never bought a Yankee candle before.  They seem overpriced.  But I took a chance guessing they were good quality.  I was right.  They burn slow and even, and the scent is strong but not overwhelming.  I like the single wicks in the small jars, am not a fan of the double wicks in the larger units but now that I see how slow they burn maybe that makes sense."
3,2021-02-08,"The scent is weak compare with other lavender candles I have. 1-wick makes it burns unevenly and always leaving the edge unmelt. So I need to use it with my candle lamp, which makes the scent even more weaker.This product is relatively cheap though."
1,2020-05-26,I received my candle on the 23rd of may 2020 and this is how i received my Candle from Yankee candle it was exposed to heat or something and I recived like this picture attached. Not happy with my purchase
5,2021-05-12,"Yankee brand is a little price, but they make a great candle!"
5,2020-03-09,Strong scent of roses the whole time it burned. And it lasted for over 100 hours!  A bit too expensive for a candle when I can get same size of other scents for $5 less
3,2020-03-04,As far as the seller transaction everything was perfect.  The candle is just very lack luster. No real scent being put off. Looks nice but that's about all.
1,2019-11-27,This is sad I used to buy this candles and loved them this one smells like nothing not even in a small bedroom with a candle lit for hours can you feel the scent. I had to buy another brand. Too bad. Not even if they where free would I get them again.
3,2020-05-27,"Not sure what I was expecting, ordering a scent that I never smelled before. But the candle is a little too floral and strong to my liking.  Candle came on the hottest day of the year, melted. Probably won’t even use it."
5,2022-04-18,Wow
3,2021-01-16,The smell wasn't there. Still a long lasting candle though. Maybe try a different scent.
4,2018-12-14,"Notes include:Top Notes: Mandarin LeafMid Notes: Jasmine, CedarwoodBase Notes: Patchouli, Sandalwood, Amber MuskI like most fresh scent candles from Yankee. I would've given this 5 stars but it's got a hint of vanilla. If you like fresh scents and a little vaniller, this is the candle for you!"
5,2017-11-30,NICE SENT
1,2018-12-17,This candle has no scent. It was a total waste of money. I bought 6 candles as Christmas gifts. I will not be giving them to the intended recipients . Totally disappointed. I’ll be going to Bath and Body Works. Their candles ALWAYS smell nice. Shame on Yankee Candle!
4,2018-03-30,I bought this candle based on most of the reviews saying that it has a sweet scent. I thought it actually has a strong lavender flowery scent. I didn't really get any sweetness. Its not bad but I prefer a sweeter scent.
1,2019-06-20,"The scent was nothing special.  I had caught the scent of the ""wedding candle"" at a bridal shower recently so I wanted it for my prayer room.  This one is nothing like the scent I remember.  :("
2,2013-05-13,"Always had a good experience with Yankee Candles, however this one was bad to say the least. Simply wanted the fresh spring scent from being outside so I purchased this scent. It did state that this was a ""retired"" scent, but I thought it would have a scent. Upon opening it had a faint Christmas pine scent, but that's ok, after lighting it, NOTHING. There is no scent, aroma anything from this candle. Hoping its from the ""retired"" class of candles. I have not attempted to return this as I had to light it to find out it didn't ""work"", smell. Probably not a warranty on ""used"" candles. Otherwise everything else from Amazon was great as usual, from communications to shipping."
1,2020-11-16,"I’m so sad, this candle doesn’t really smell like lavender at all. It’s very a faint scent. I won’t be purchasing from yankee again."
3,2018-06-07,"Back in the 1970s, all candles had a generic ""candle smell"" which was a vaguely floral and barely noticeable scent. This has Candle Smell in a YC jar. It wasn't what I was hoping for in a bathroom candle, but it will have to do I suppose."
5,2020-03-23,"This is an exchange for a fragrance I didn't like at all. It arrived quickly, packaged well, and smells beautiful. I'll buy more from this seller."
5,2020-05-22,"Lit this candle for my bathroom.After a few hours, the wax had barely gone down leaving the bathroom smelling pleasant."
5,2019-05-05,Lol no scent yeah right / I almost dint get this because of reviews of no order but price was good now it’s great because I love this scent / it’s like smelling a sweet lavender flower it’s not strong like you walk into a room of cupcakes 🤭🤢but I love it lol
4,2020-09-28,"Looked like there were some slight imperfections on the candle, but overall happy with scent."
5,2022-05-18,Love the scent of this candle
5,2019-03-25,Covers up the smell of my gnarly farts
1,2019-03-22,This candle hardly even burns. The flame is so tiny and constantly goes out. I’m surprised at how terrible it was considering the price. I’ve had much better (and cheaper) candles from Marshall’s and Ross.
1,2019-05-25,Major disappointment. I've been burning this for at least 6 hours and I don't smell anything!! This is the 2nd Yankee candle that hardly gives off any scent. Don't waste your $!! But another brand.
1,2020-11-05,Will potentially melt and become reshaped before it gets to you. Had to melt it down to pull out wick and reset it........
5,2019-05-07,The smell is light (yet potent) and very spring/summer friendly. I light two of these puppies (sometimes one) after cleaning downstairs and it wafts to the upstairs in the most pleasant manner.
1,2020-05-16,"For some reason, I could not smell the candle. I have never had this problem with Yankee Candle before. I returned it."
1,2020-11-03,"Got the first one and looked like it was melted over, no wick anywhere to even get it lit.  Got it replaced for free with another one...Same problem!"
5,2020-01-05,Gave this to my husband and when we do yoga this has a strong but tolerable wonderful scent. Will continue using this as our go to pm yoga scent.
5,2019-11-09,Love Candles. Yankee candles are the best and they last long.  Lavender is my favorite but like others too.  They really have a nice sent and not over powering.
5,2021-06-09,I enjoyed this candle. Strong scented.
3,2019-08-10,"The lavender vanilla small tumbler is pretty, but the smell is weak. I can barely smell it when it’s on my nightstand. I’m so disappointed but I’ve already used it and can’t return it."
5,2020-08-10,I like to burn scented candles in my living room. This Lavender candle has a very pleasant fragrance.
1,2020-08-29,The smell was good and that's all because the glass was broken and this is the second one
4,2018-09-07,"When I was a child my neighbor's house used to have a huge lilac bush.This really smells like true lilac.The strengths of the fragrance is remarkable, however if you are scent-sensitive like my son, this is not the candle for you.I took one star off because I realized that I am not such a fan of the lilac scent anymore as compared to childhood.I am not even confident that this is fair of me to do so.If you are a fan of lilac or flower scents, this is a very fragrant wonderful candle that you would truly enjoy."
5,2016-06-11,I love anything Yankee Candle really.  this Lavender scent is fantastic and very relaxing.  So far it has lasted me a month and is only half burned.  Always worth the cost of a Yankee Candle.
3,2017-06-05,"I bought the name.  I was NOT happy with it at all.  The smell was nice when you smelled the candle, but burning you could hardly smell.  Love the White Barn candles as they smell awesome and got so many compliments even when it hadn't been burning that day!  Very disappointed."
5,2021-02-12,Yankee Candle is always high quality and the package came packed well with none of the candles broken. I use them daily and love the gentle lavender scent perfect for my office.
3,2019-09-19,The scent was too light for me. I wanted it to get Zen and kill cooking odors. It really isn’t strong enough for a kitchen candle. Maybe in a small bedroom?
4,2020-05-19,"I bought the Gardenia scent  - both the newer and older versions of these candles: the older version I bought on Ebay.  This newer candle has a slightly stronger scent than the older candle I also bought.  It's a lovely, creamy light scent.  It might smell stronger if the candle were in a closed, airless room but the room I keep it in has an open window so the scent is not that strong which is a shame."
5,2020-11-09,"I love Yankee Candle, this Lavender and Citrus and Sage are my favorite."
5,2020-12-18,Beautiful candle. Smells nice and it was packaged nicely.
5,2019-02-05,This candle was discontinued by Yankee Candle Company around 2015(ish) it's what I remember. Yankee never brings it back from what I know? So GREAT to see it sold here on Amazon! It's a tribute to my Mother I buy every year if I can find it who passed Feb. 2015. It is a med. scent that really does smell like roses. Thank u Amazon & Seller for selling this. I love it!
1,2019-02-16,"The glass was scratched. The candle is loosely in jar. If I turn over the jar, the candle comes right out. The candle jar does not stand up straight. A lot of issues with this one."
1,2021-05-09,Candle has no scent when lit.
3,2020-12-03,The candle is very pretty. Unfortunately there is no scent.
5,2012-10-22,"The price is steeper than most candles but the product is worth the few extra bucks since it burns longer & the odor is consistently produced down to the last burn.This scent - well, ""to each his own"", but I happen to like it because it's not too ""fake"" smelling, like some candles that try to imitate the smell of roses or otherwise."
2,2018-12-04,I have a very good sense of smell and after reading the reviews I had hoped for a candle that was actually FRAGRANT... The lavender/vanilla candle I ordered does not emit any fragrance. I will stick with my Scentsy dealer.
3,2020-08-15,"Pretty color but perfume is a bit confusing, don’t care for it very much"
4,2017-11-04,"The candle was exactly what I thought it would be, a candle. Lol. I ordered two but one broke during shipping. I was refunded my money with no issues. I was very satisfied and would order this item again."
5,2019-09-28,My mom wants more of this for her birthday now. I bought It for a Mother’s Day gift and she is a picky person. So now i am going to buy a bigger one for her.
5,2020-12-19,Typical Yankee Candle quality. Arrived packaged well.
5,2020-12-28,"It smells good, and a gift u would give to someone."
1,2018-04-28,"Seems like a counterfeit product. Weak smell, slightly different label on bottoms than one bought in store, and burns differently than ones bought from store. Lavender purple was bought on amazon and white one was bought in a store. I don’t recommend buying on Amazon."
1,2021-03-08,Doesn't smell.... Nothing
5,2021-03-16,Delightful scent. My wife's favourite
5,2021-07-11,"Love the scent. Cannot give answer regarding longevity, since only used 1 day"
5,2017-08-14,Smells great
1,2020-05-25,"I was so excited when I got my Lavender scented candles. But, when I lit it there was no scent at all, I have previous bought this same candle at Bed Bath and Beyond with a great scent throughout the 150 hours. Very disappointed for the price I paid for 2 candles. I couldn't submit with a zero rating so I had to pick a 1 star rating even though that is to generous."
1,2020-07-22,Love the scent. But unable to use as you can see in pictures. This is my second order and they arrived worse than the first time. It melted all the way to the top and must’ve dried. There’s no wick to light candle. And not to mention that when I open the box the liquid from candle got all over my hands and even stained my carpet. And I was carefully since the box itself had stains and was leaking. Horrible packaging.
5,2013-11-19,"The candle is appropriately scented and is subtle, which is a feature often missed by the candle makers.  It is just a bit of the outdoors without being too powerful.  A very nice characteristic is the long and even burn.  Nice quality and don't let the title of the product scare you away, it is nice."
1,2019-11-24,Never ordered this and now I have card fraud and my card is off. So who ever used my card info I hope you like the candle
5,2019-04-21,"I bought this to relax. Lavander is known for its calming effect. Yankee candle jars burn well. If you use a lampshade, remember to wipe the soot off."
5,2020-07-26,Yankee candles are the best it smells just like theyr advertised
4,2021-03-15,"I recently got into candles, so I bought this online. I was lucky it arrived in good conditions compared to other reviewers. The scent was strong (in a good way) the first time I lighted it up, but diminished a bit after the following days of lighting it up. I had problems with the wick, but after cutting it a few times, it worked great. Candle lasted a few days, so in that sense, it was definitely worth the money."
5,2020-11-14,"This candle is so relaxing, we use it almost every day."
3,2018-12-16,"*Notes include*Top Notes: Citrus, Melon, BerryMid Notes: OsmanthusBase Notes: Spicy Vanilla, Musk, Woody NotesNot the best Yankee Candle. It's like a big bowl of sugary goodness with a dose of melon. I've bought this as a car freshner and it was decent. The 22oz jar makes my house smell like a pre-teen girls sleepover while watching Hello Kitty on Tv."
4,2018-01-31,"This candle smells very nice & delightful. I will say it is VERY strong so if you like strong scents this is a great match. I wish the scent was just a but more subtle but that is only my personal preference. The color is a lovely light pink shade and looks exactly as displayed in the photo. I really like Yankee candles but I have to say this one is not my fave. It is however, a nice addition to the yankee candles that I already have.I hope this review helps you! :) I try to be objective, detailed and always completely honest with my reviews. I love to help others to make smart buying choices for themselves. If this review was helpful to you, please click on the YES button.

5,2019-03-29,"I love Yankee Candle Company. I especially love this Rose scented candle. Smells is amazing. Not powdery or overwhelming. A subtle, fresh smell. Burns slow."
1,2019-02-21,"Save your money for something better, this candle is COMPLETE GARBAGE. It smelled nice in the jar, but it puts off no fragrance at all when it's burning. Total RIP OFF!"
3,2019-04-09,"I burned this candle, and forgot it was burning. I think it would be good if a couple candles in a living room.  But I don't recommend it in a large room."
5,2019-01-30,Doesn’t smell like true lavender up close but if you let the smell disperse through your house then you have a really solid fresh lavender scent. Very pleased with Yankee Candle once again!
5,2021-02-09,Love the smell and I only buy Yankee candles. Last for a very long time!
5,2018-08-09,"I bought this for a friend's 65th birthday. She likes roses and has burned this several times already, telling me that the scent is lovely. I expect quality from Yankee Candle and this delivers."
2,2021-05-22,"I can’t take a photo because it didn’t last long enough. Kind of disappointed with Yankee. This used to be my favorite, but the quality & longevity isn’t worth the price anymore.The scent is great- if you have your nose glued to the jar. Otherwise, I didn’t find it emitted much of anything (even in a tiny, studio apartment). I only had it burning for 2-3 hours on occasion, but it didn’t last more than a month. And, the wick wasn’t strong enough to keep a decent flame... started to stifle with pooling wax that also dissipated so quickly the entire thing didn’t last.I would feel bad giving this as a gift. As nice as it seems- it isn’t worth it and kind of a waste of money. Their candles used to be WAY better in scent & longevity. That isn’t the case anymore, and I can’t justify buying another after this one didn’t last more than 30 days leaving little scent to enjoy."
5,2020-08-16,i love this candle soooo much the scent is  strong and amazing
4,2021-02-10,"The wicked burns kind of big, the aroma is pretty strong for a small area of about 200 square feet.  Really strong for a bathroom.  It does not help neutralize strong odors, it overpowers them for a while, but it dissipates relatively fast.  It lasts about 1 hour.  I don't particularly like the scent, it smells like a department store, but it works fine.  I would buy again if liked the scent better."
5,2020-08-10,I love having this in my bathroom.  Nice scent but not overpowering.
5,2019-02-26,"I absolutely love the smell of this lavender candle. It's so soothing, relaxing & invigorating, it had my entire room smelling fabulous. Great for burning at night time."
5,2018-12-02,"Classic Yankee candle. The smell is very similiar to a fabric softener smell and I like that. No issues at all, the the reliable Yankee brand I know. I would buy again."
5,2019-07-16,"Very pretty display, smells like soft roses, looks nice in room on table side, you can buy this candle at stores in community for cheaper!"
5,2014-01-09,"My husband got this candle as a gag gift around Christmas.  I expected it to smell nothing like a riding mower, but somehow it does!  A bit of oil, a bit of grass, and something you can't identify.  Oddly with all that it actual smells good too.  I definitely didn't expect this to be a good buy, but I was wrong!"
5,2015-02-03,Gift for my sister was well received and I'm told smelt lovely
3,2020-05-28,I was looking for something that smells like real lavender. This does not.
5,2016-05-11,This candle is a repeated purchase of mine. I buy  nothing else for my home but fresh cut roses by Yankee because the scent is powerful but not overpowering to the senses. It fills the entire great room with a fresh inviting smell that is soothing.
5,2020-02-14,"Favorite scent, this is what I love about amazon. When you cant find it in the shop you'll find it here."
2,2019-02-06,Not as fragrant as other less expensive candles I have purchased. It was not calming and relaxing like lavender should be.  Too expensive and not worth it!
5,2018-05-17,Love the Lavender scent. So disappointed they have discontinued the pure Lavender and the pure Lemon scents. There are mixed scents available now but they are not the same!
2,2020-06-13,"The Beach Walk Yankee candle has a heavenly , cool, clean scent of a summer at the lake.  I live one street behind Lake Michigan, and whenever I am outside on a breezy day , and can smell the beach.  It  is a relaxing and comfortable feeling.  That's how I would describe the interior of my home when the I go out, come  in , and inhale the scent of this candle.  I would rate it a solid five stars, except that my particular candle has a split wick, and every time I light it, it flickers and smokes continuously.  No matter how many times I cut the wick back, it  ultimately splits again and again, and smokes again and again.  I cannot  enjoy it for more than 10 minutes or so, before I have to snuff it out.  Mine was a glitch.  I will buy it again all summer long because this was a one time defect, and it wonderful.  Cheryl"
4,2010-08-11,"This candle releases a good Honeysuckle odor that is not overpowering and is perfect for any room size. The best part is that the burning time last for awhile! The burning time is much longer than cheap traditional candles. Although you might pay a little more for this one, you get what you pay for in the end."
5,2019-07-25,I love their true Gardenia scent and always take one of their candles with us while traveling for a wonderful scented room.
3,2020-11-21,Size as expected. Scent was less on the lavender and heavier on the candle scent.
4,2008-05-02,"I am very happy with the product and the short time it took to receive it.The jar, unforunately, broke during shipping but not a fault of the seller. The item was well packaged so I suspect poor handling by USPostal Service.  In any case, seller sent compimentary matching small jar candles in same fragrance as good will gesture.  I would buy from this seller again."
5,2021-01-21,burns perfectly.
3,2020-07-01,The candle smells wonderful. I gave it 3 stars because it arrived broken but I'm still keeping it. they really need to pack it much better
2,2021-03-21,"This is my first time ordering a Yankee Candle. Read all the hype on this brand. Watched a couple of YouTubes; was impressed. I was juusst about to buy another brand which was going to cost me $15 for only 6 ounces (should have stuck with that choice). However, I found some Yankee Candles at a good price. Received my ""Pink Sands"" candle fast! (happy/excited) But what a BIG disappointment! Absolutely ""No scent"" from my candle? And No, I don't have Covid (lol) Usually you can smell at least a slight scent during the unboxing stage. Even when removing the lid, still no scent? That should have been a hint. However, I thought ""maybe"" I needed to burn it to smell it. Still nothing? Placed it in a small bathroom with the door closed for about 15 min, still no scent? Tested on two other people ~ same result. Is it possible I got a ""DUD""? Maybe it is old?  I don't need an expensive emergency ""power outage"" candle. What a waste of money! Unsatisfied Customer here for sure! Even though it said it was new on the listing, It ""seems"" like it was maybe a return? And I'm sure if it was, it was due to the same problem. Unfortunately, you can only return the candle in new or unused condition. All the favorite Yankee Candle scents that YouTubers put in their top/favorite lists like, ""Pomegranate Cider"" or ""Pumpkin Wreath"" are recently listed for double compared to what I paid. My candle ""Pink Sands"" was one of the lowest priced Yankee Candles I came across. Now I know why....I gave a rating of at least two stars. 1 for fast shipping and 1 for no broken glass."
5,2019-04-30,"I like the color, and the scent before lighting, once lit however, it has to burn for an extended period of time before the aroma fills the room."
1,2021-08-28,"This candle is very small.  It is just slightly larger than a votive.  Not what I expected so I regret the purchase.  Also, the scent in undetectable when the candle is lit."
2,2020-10-17,"Can barely smell this, even after burning for hours. (Lavender scent)"
5,2022-05-02,-
4,2022-06-18,"Bought the lilac smell, smells good but the smell doesn't last or goes very far in the room. used to be Yankee candles were really good but something has changed with them because the smell doesn't go very far and the smell doesn't last."
5,2021-12-13,The candle is the same as sold in stores except for a better price. I am very satisfied.
4,2016-06-04,Smells amazing! Really smells like fresh cut roses and not like some horrible toilets spray.However this is a 7oz candle jar advertised with a 12.5oz picture. Very misleading!
1,2019-01-06,I can’t use this because it came shattered. Before I even opened the box I could hear the glass rattling around. Amazon not being helpful with replacing the item. Surprise 🙄
3,2020-08-14,This did not smell like lavender.
1,2020-10-24,The entire Yankee Lavender Large Candle was melted to one side and inside the top.....melted was residue was on the outside of the box also.
5,2020-01-17,Beautiful apricot and Rose scent. The throw is low though unless you burn in a smaller room.
5,2019-07-27,Love this smell  although don’t buy the car fragrance because you can’t return it and it smells like crap
5,2018-02-18,"This is one of Yankee candles most beautiful candles. Have not been able to find a candle that captures the honeysuckle scent as well as Yankee candle does, and they discontinued it! Why??"
3,2019-06-30,This does not take the place of Relaxing Lavender.  It does not have the same scent or as strong.  This is a bummer.
3,2021-02-25,I ordered a bunch of candles for my new apartment. The worst by far were all the Yankee Candles. They all smell terrible.
5,2020-03-11,"It filled the bill, so to speak and made a delightful Christmas gift."
4,2021-06-30,I should have made note of the size.  It is smaller than I expected.  It smells fantastic.
5,2021-03-28,like it
5,2019-04-30,This is by far my favorite rose scented candle! It is a soft floral scent that you can smell even in a larger room. The candle also lasts for a long time. Definitely recommend!
5,2021-02-16,Love it
4,2021-05-08,"The smell is fine and a little bit weak, but not weak enough to complain."
5,2018-02-17,"Although it doesn't smell like pure roses, it does smell very pleasant and works really well. The scent covers 2 rooms and a hall. Will purchase again at that price. Very satisfied."
5,2017-10-19,Yankee candles are the best!
3,2019-03-20,Love the smell of Lavender/Vanilla but this candle does not have a very strong smell.  Can hardly tell at all in a small room.
5,2014-03-19,"I purchased this candle for my mother for Mothers Day 2013, it is now March 2014 and the candle still has burning time in it. She is always lighting this thing, it has a beautiful scent, it spread throughout the house like no other candle before it. Highly recommend this candle."
5,2011-07-02,"This candle is the best capture of geniune lilac fragrance that I have found. I LOVE it. One male co-worker thought it smelled like roses, but I think he just did not know his flower fragrances. Wonderful spring smell that fills a room; totally delightful."
2,2022-06-30,A friend has this candle in her office and it can be smelled throughout the building. I love candles and a loyal Circle E candle fan. I decided to step outside the box and try this candle in my home.The glass jar is beautiful but the scent is not strong at all.You win some. You lose some.Won't buy again though but will keep the pretty glass jar.
5,2019-05-25,Great gift for Mother's Day. Smells exactly like it says.
5,2018-11-21,Dual wicks ensured the large candle burned equally and fully.  Jasmine fragrance kept the room scented without overwhelming the senses.
2,2019-03-08,"I love yankee candles but this scent was weak to barely  any sent,"
3,2021-04-19,"Too much of a rose scent for me, still a nice candle though"
3,2014-01-07,"Love the aroma, but this size jar does not burn well. There is 1/4 of the wax left when the wick is burned out, and it burns in a well-must push soft wax down jar to even get that much. Very wasteful and too expensive. I am very disappointed and will not order this size ever again."
5,2021-02-28,Good fragrance lasts a long time.
5,2021-02-13,Best floral scent that YK makes.
5,2020-12-14,I purchased more for gifts
4,2019-08-25,Love the relaxing lilac scent after a long work night...Yankee Candle always is the best
3,2019-03-29,"Smells great but didn't burn very evenly, completely or slowly. Nice scent but not enough value for the money."
5,2017-04-25,"Very aromatic candle, truly rose fragrance."
4,2021-06-13,"I hope this is a legit one, as it came with no label. I got it, because I have a beach theme in my house, and thought the label would even look cute, when I was burning it. But now no label. It smells ok, but the candle doesn't totally look right either. The other one I ordered, looks fine and with a label."
4,2022-01-16,"Very good lovely scent but when there was maybe 3/4 of an inch left of the candle, I lit it and it sent off the hallway fire alarms of my apartment complex but not my own apartment fire alarm. I guess strong smell of plastic indicated it should've been thrown out slightly before then."
1,2018-07-22,"This candle has pretty much zero scent when lit. It’s fragrant when not lit which really doesn’t make any sense. I’ve had yankee candles in the past and they’ll fill a room with the scent, it even will travel upstairs... this one was a waste of money. Only reason I won’t/can’t return it is because I’m currently living overseas and the cost to send it back would be about the same cost of the dang scentless candle."
5,2020-02-08,The fragrance is soft and smell wonderful when you burn it.
5,2018-08-05,Smells just like freshly cut peonies.Fragrance lasts for the life of the candle
5,2013-06-07,"If you're like me you have favorite candle scents and sometimes they are best being simple in their fragrance. I like to have to Lavander on me or around me when I go to sleep;  via lotion, aromatherapy oil on my wrists and a candle.Great because it's not to be mixed with a Vanilla scent!"
5,2019-04-18,One of the most lovely and relaxing candles ever. Smells legit like a rose garden. You feel fancy af.
2,2020-07-31,"I'm very confused, I normally buy Yankee Candles at TJ Maxx or HomeGoods and they have a much stronger scent! In fact I have this exact candle in a larger size that smells way better! It's like this candle wax is old and it gives off absolutely no scent whatsoever! I should have known better and saved my money. First time I ever ordered a candle like this online that I have bought in a store, I will never do it again. You think it has a great smell until you burn it and you realize it doesn't have a smell hardly at all! Like it's old or something. Unfortunately, you can't return it once you've lit the thing so I guess I won't be buying Yankee Candles online again"
2,2020-02-16,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 I love the smell but my candle arrived broken I’m so disappointed. I was really excited for it but it just left me paranoid in ordering it again 😔"
5,2012-09-11,Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
5,2020-03-11,Love it! Delivered in perfect condition!
5,2017-07-21,This is my favorite Yankee candle scent by far! It feels my whole house fairly quickly with the sweet smell of true honeysuckle! Just wish it was easier to find! Highly recommend!
5,2020-08-09,This is my favorite bedroom candle.
1,2020-05-30,Have always been happy with Yankee Candles but this has minimal scent.  Will never buy Yankee products again.
1,2017-03-03,I have it sitting not 4 feet from my head and i still can not smell anything. You have to put your nose right up to it. It's a shame i was looking forward to it.
5,2018-12-30,"My boyfriend loved it, he asked me if I had to order it because we could not find lavender scented candles in the store."
5,2010-10-30,"Yankee candles make the best gift! I purchased this item for a friend recently and she loves it.  I am a fan of Yankee candles and I will never go back to any other brand of candles. They smell great and last for a long time. They are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for...great quality!"
5,2019-02-26,"This candle smells amazing and it burns evenly, just remember to trim the wicks before lighting it each time"
1,2020-06-09,"it arrived broken, damage"
5,2018-12-25,"This was purchased as a gift.  It smells great.  If it burns like my balsam and cedar candle, it does great."
1,2019-08-26,"This is a ""barely"" scented candle.  Yankee is NOT the company it used to be.  I will not buy another Yankee candle."
5,2015-05-09,"I LOVE rose scent, this is great and it smells wonderful. Currently burning it right now! (if possible, use a ceramic topper, it burns all the way down, nothing left on the sides. Wonderful buy!!"
5,2018-10-29,Smells Amazing. Great pricing packaging awesome quickly shipping
5,2020-03-05,Pleasant scent that is not irritating at all. (I am sensitive to a lot of scents)
5,2017-02-24,"LOVE MY LAVENDER AND EVEN THOUGH I COULD PROBABLY FIND A CHEAPER CANDLE, YANKEE CANDLE IS A TOP NOTCH CANDLE COMPANY AND THE FRAGRANCE IS GREAT! THANKS!"
3,2021-04-27,i generally buy white barn three wick candles but i saw this was on sale and decides to try pink sands bc i was curious. this candle was cheap bc the smell is so faint that unless you’re literally standing over it you smell nothing. it also burns very quickly. Save your money and buy the higher quality white barn candles. These was a complete waste of money and time.
5,2018-03-17,"Clean, light scent.  Not overpowering.  If you are looking for a scent that says clean and fresh when you enter your house, look no further. Love it."
5,2019-12-30,Absolutely LOVE this scent. Will be purchasing again!
5,2013-05-20,"I agree with previous reviewers - smells like real thing. One of my favorite along with Pineapple-Cilantro. I use them only with candle warmers - Candle Warmers Etc. 
  
Candle Warmers Etc. Signature Aurora Candle Warmer Lamp, Bronze"
5,2018-10-11,Love Yankee candles always. I always have them in home.
5,2020-04-23,Product came professionally packaged and is exactly what I ordered!  Love it!
5,2019-07-22,Really nothing to say it is a yankee candle one of the best.
5,2016-10-17,"Bought this for one of my altars since the incense was bothering my spouse. It's absolutely perfect, and has a great strong but not overpowering aroma of roses."
1,2021-03-27,I tried to order a lavender scented candle. First candle was the right size but the wrong scent. I ordered a replacement. Second candle was the wrong scent and the wrong size. Ridiculous.
5,2021-11-25,What's there not to like about your candles. These candles fits any mood you might have and will last forever
5,2020-11-19,Excellent
5,2020-05-31,Would buy again
5,2020-05-12,Highly fragrant and smells just like roses!
5,2018-09-19,Well worth the price.  Comes packaged very very well
4,2018-07-19,It is a bit too mild. I with the wick was thicker so it would last longer and the wax wouldn't be wasted stuck to the sides of the glass
4,2017-03-19,if i was able to afford it i would burn these non stop everywhere i went. i really love the scent and the two wick version of this candle.
5,2019-12-01,Great product just as described
4,2020-10-23,"Enchanted Moon is a nice scent.  It is an older candle and they lose some scent.  Still, it does smell good and provides a perfect light for Halloween.  When you buy for half the price. You’re getting an older product.  If you want the freshest best throw, buy direct for full price.  Wax packaged well and candle was perfect."
3,2017-02-26,Has distinct rose scent but I would not agree with the reviewers saying that it is a light scent or not very strong. The scent is very evident and strong. Gave my roommate a headache after only a short period of burning the candle.
5,2018-06-22,Love this candle filled the whole house with the smell of lilac made me feel like I was back in New England( live in Phoenix now)
5,2018-11-12,Love the scent! I light it before bed every night. Lasts so long! Will buy again once it burns out.
5,2019-03-18,It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It smells amazing and burns for a long time. My only complaint is that there were air bubbles pressed agaist the glass that made the appearance of the candle a little less pristine.
4,2021-02-28,"Well, we all know how expensive these guys can be, but some scents are worth it to me.  I wait with bated breath for Hearts and Roses to return, but am not optimistic about it.  This one, Enchanted Moon, will disappear, too, I am sure.  So I was glad to see this available at least a little while longer.  Sigh."
3,2018-06-19,I love the Sun and Sand scent from Yankee Candle but it seems that the scent doesn't last as long as it used to.
2,2020-05-06,Actually SUPER disappointed with these candles. Yankee candles have always been my favorite. I’ve always been able to count on them to keep my home smelling fresh and clean. The lavender vanilla is one of my favorite scents because it’s such a relaxing scent. I bought two because I burn through them so quickly and I NEITHER of these candles give off a scent at all... $40 wasted. : ( Not sure I’ll ever buy a yankee candle from here again. At least I know I what I can expect from the store or website itself.
5,2012-10-24,"I LIVE Yankee candles. When this scent came out, I was so excited because the smell was nice. Little did I know that this 22 ounce jar would be able to emit scents throughout an entire room, even while it wasn't lit. I can smell this candle no matter what, and it is hands down my favorite scent!"
1,2019-04-16,The scent is TOO STRONG. I recommend purchasing Midsummer Nights Dream.
1,2020-09-14,This is not a real yankee candle. The sticker has been placed on the candle and put in a Yankee Candle box. Has no scent before burning nor after lighting the candle.
5,2014-06-24,"My room has high ceilings and is large.  It is difficult to get a candle with  enough throw to enjoy it.  The 2 wick tumblers are the answer for me.This fragrance is relaxing, flowery and not overwhelming at all."
1,2020-12-24,when I recieved the candle it was all melted in the could not even burn it and I had opened it and threw the box away so did not even noticed that it was all melted...$17.00 dollars down the drain. Very unhappy with this purchase.
5,2014-03-04,"I love to burn lavendar candles.  They have the freshest, cleanest smell.i have a very difficult time finding pure lavendar .  Yankee seems to think it needs to be combined with vanilla or lemon or some other scent.  I think all that does is ruin the true essence of lavendar! Vanilla was the first scent that ever came out in candles, and i burned so many vanilla candles, that i cannot stand the smell of vanilla today!"
5,2018-02-28,Of course it’s 5 stars its Yankee Candle! Anddddd packaging was 100% on point! Fast shipping! Great job alllll around !
4,2018-09-16,One complain on how they shipped my 4 candles. Two came sperate small yankee candle boxes inside the the shipment box and two did not. By doing this when I opened my box one of the candles was completely shattered so to how they shipped them. Other then this problem I love yankee candles and you can get them for half the price on amazon. My favorite scent is the pink sands. Last long and makes our home smell great!!
4,2019-08-18,"Smells good, but size does not reflect the price."
4,2020-05-21,Smells great
5,2019-08-19,My favorite yankee scent!! It's soft and feminine. I love to burn this candle in my bedroom.
4,2020-01-20,It was completely broken when I opened it....
5,2019-03-05,"Smells good but not a strong scent.Burns nicely ,evenly all the way down."
5,2011-10-10,"This candle smells nice, and it burns down evenly.  Not doing that is the biggest problem we've found with large candles - and then they don't last nearly as long.  This also looks very nice with the cap for when you're not using it."
5,2018-09-21,Love love love the smell of this amazing candle. Will definitely buy another when done 😁
4,2020-12-13,"Love how long the candle lasts although, the scent wasn't as strong at first. But, over time it started to fill my room and it seemed to work fine to me."
5,2013-01-04,I just love the smell of lilacs in the summertime. But now I can also enjoy it in the winter time. This candle smells just like a Lilac bush inside the house. I really like it. It is what it says it is and more.
5,2014-02-14,"When I first found this scent, I was thrilled... then I couldn't find it anymore!?!  Yankee Candle said (at the time), that it was a seasonal fragrance. I can only assume, that due to it's popularity, they revised that concept and now offer it year round"
4,2019-01-04,"I love the smell of this lilac scented candle.Its a oerfect smell of lilac than ever I smelled in my whole like.Great price for the size and burns almost to when it needs to.Almost to the bottom,which some are not great in the past I tried and didnt burn out all the wax completely.It more smells fragrant in the jar than it brings out a smell in a room.Still its the best floral smell I smelled and its just worth so much.That it smells lije lilacs.The real thing."
5,2019-05-22,Lavender is the best!
5,2015-10-08,The jar is quite large and has a very good burn time.The scent is strong enough to fill my living room but not overpowering.I've found Yankee Candles have spoiled me and I expect every candle I purchase to fully fill my rooms with the scent as well as this jar does.
5,2019-12-21,Perfect gift
1,2020-06-24,My candle arrived completely shattered!
2,2020-12-24,No label on candle didnt look like picture on site
5,2019-12-27,Good cost
4,2020-09-08,To small for the price of it
5,2014-04-24,I bought this to burn on the anniversary of my mothers passing as roses were her favorite.It scented the whole house and even after 24 hours of burning I can use it again next year for another 24.
5,2016-05-12,"Best quality candles, excellent fragrance, a bit expensive but long lasting and smell beautiful. Keep glass top on when not in use."
5,2021-08-02,Really wish Yankee would bring this Lavender scent back!!
1,2020-05-13,Very disappointed. Paid good money for this product. Lacks fragrance and seemed to have additional wax poured in top and hardened.
5,2018-01-29,This candle smells absolutely wonderful. It's perfect to freshen up my bedroom!
5,2018-09-25,"Bought this for the color, hard to find a deeper pink. And to top it off, it smell good, too!"
5,2020-01-03,No comments
5,2020-09-22,"its super scented, so it's great! It lasts a really long time!"
4,2022-06-01,"We were curious to know what Pink Sand smelled like. Sea weed, dead fish lowtide? Turns out it's kind of an indistinct floral, earthy scent. Not great."
1,2020-10-04,"This scent was waaayyyy too strong. At the risk of sounding rude, this reminded me of an expired perfume. The peony is the only note I could smell. Not halloween or spooky smelling.Defintely returning"
5,2017-06-10,👍🏻
5,2020-04-04,Very Good
5,2018-09-11,Love my lavender scented candle!
5,2019-04-30,"I love lavender candles, and it’s very relaxing. It gives an living space an amazing calming and pleasant smell."
5,2015-02-10,This is one of my favorite candles...since I no longer live close to the beach and going there is not an option all I have to do is light this candle and close my eyes and I am there! Amazing how they captured a day at the beach in a candle!!
1,2019-07-26,"Waste of money, has no smell."
5,2018-08-03,"Holy s#%t Batman, these are the bomb!! My husband and I are vegan and these are a perfect treat!!"
5,2019-07-02,"Good price, delivered fast. Candle has a nice scent."
5,2019-03-29,I found this scent by accident and it is so amazing. It is like the blue ocean. So I bought several of them!
5,2017-03-18,I cant get this anywhere . I love the smell and Yankee doesnt sell it anymore.
4,2022-02-11,Smaller than I expected. The smell was strong when opened but doesn’t smell as strong when lit. Candle also doesn’t stay lit. Love the smell though
5,2018-10-21,Beautiful scent!!
5,2018-07-11,The best gift I ever gave..... They couldn't find any in the Yankee Candle stores...Yah!!
3,2015-11-11,"It smells good, but I can tell the candle is a little old. I know this is a discontinued scent so I knew it wouldn't be brand new. I think they should have discounted the price."
5,2019-08-30,"The best! If you find it in car fresheners, grab one!"
5,2019-03-11,"I love yankee candles. The package came promptly, and is authentic."
5,2017-02-14,This candle fills the room with a wonderful Jasmine scent. All to many scented candles have no scent unless you are standing right next to it.
5,2019-06-04,Wonderful candles love the smell
5,2019-06-20,Great gift lasts long when used.
1,2021-02-15,No lavender scent whatsoever. Does not burn clean.
5,2018-03-08,"This has a very soft, delightful smell. I'm very sensitive to strong scents, but this is very good."
5,2019-07-06,very nice scent! love it
3,2019-01-22,I didn't care for the smell it reminded me of a man's colonge
5,2019-12-28,Truly smells like jasmine.
5,2020-12-07,We like the product. We even made it work but when we received the package the glass around the candle was broken. When I picked up the box to open u can hear scattered glass inside. Need better packing.
2,2020-07-08,"I use to buy Yankee candles 40 years ago, and I remember lighting one candle in a room, and the smell would fill up the whole house. Guests always noticed, and my favorite was Midsummer's night. As the years went by, I noticed a marked decrease in the quality of the candles, although I would still buy them, hoping it was just my perception. This candle has a zillion positive reviews and I don't know why. It doesn't have any throw, it sells cheap, and there's nothing remarkable about it at all. Ounce per ounce, you should invest in Nest brand candles;  they are luxury candles, but nothing compares unless you want to pay several hundred dollars. The smells are complex yet pleasing, and there's something for everyone."
5,2019-08-20,Smells great!
5,2015-12-31,"My favorite candle scent from yankee candle.  I always have trouble with the jars tunneling but not with the tumbler.  Very happy with this candle.  Will repurchase the sent, guaranteed."
5,2012-12-24,"Yankee candles make the best fragrances, and are favorites with the ladies in my family.  The White Gardenia is especially nice, and since it's not seasonal can be used year round.  Bought it for my daughter in law, and I know she'll love it."
5,2016-05-18,"Arrived quickly and unlike some rose scented candles I've had, it has a delicate but genuine rose scent when burning, really lovely. And Yankee candles seem to burn forever."
1,2020-10-11,This is the first time I have ever had a problem with Amazon delivery. The candle had been lit before and the wick was black. The person who got it said there was also an oil stain in the wrapping.
3,2019-11-23,"Candle is nice, scent is nice, but the candle arrived with the glass broken due to poor packaging."
5,2019-03-29,"High quality, beautifully scented candle."
2,2020-05-09,I purchased the color me happy candle hoping it would be a fruity fresh scent. I was terribly disappointed when I lit the candle 3 times already for about 2 hours each time and smell nothing.
5,2019-01-06,Had this lit for a couple hours before bed and I slept like a baby. Pleasant but not overwhelming scent.
3,2022-04-26,"I am always trying new candles. I know this brand has been around for a long time. The size you get for the value is great. However, the scent isn’t there for me. I was hoping for a stronger scented candle. I would not purchase this again since the scent is very very mild but I think it’s a solid buy and would make a great gift."
4,2016-02-03,BrandsForAll gets 5 stars! But the candle gets 4. Great flowery smell w/ hint of lavender. I'm going to purchase the french lavender yankee candle next and see if that's a better smell.
4,2013-06-15,"Definitely a cut grass scent, but kinda an odd chemical smell on the undertones. Like Air-Wick or something.Favorite above all is the Yankee Potpourri scent. Clean and natural on all aspects"
4,2012-12-27,I bought this as part of a shower gift of many items. It's a cute idea but i'm not sure what a wedding is supposed to smell like? i think this smelled a little linen-y; I wasn't sure what to expect.
5,2018-01-18,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this honeysuckle- great scent, reminds me of growing up with honeysuckle in my backyard!"
4,2018-12-10,"Nice scent, but the smoke from when I blew it out made the color dingy."
4,2018-02-24,"Smells amazing & burns evenly. Yankee candle has lost strength in fragrance over the last few years, so this candle is about a 7/10 rather than the full strength they used to be. I paid about $15 & I’d probably repurchase this one. Yankee just isn’t worth full retail prices anymore. Best description of this scent is a sweet, clean fragrance with a small hint of floral."
5,2020-02-04,Gift
4,2022-01-22,"The scent was very pleasant, light, and spring-like.  However, after the 1-2 hour mark, the scent becomes strong in the living room (location of the candle) causing headaches that make us have to turn it off. Use it every other couple of days and keep the house smelling pretty good, would recommend it as a gift as well."
5,2014-10-03,Love this scent. Reminds me of lilacs and a mix of orange blossom. Cant go wrong with Yankee Candle. The scent fills a room nicely (bedroom size sm-med). Great candles.
5,2019-02-27,If you love the scent of roses this one is for you.
2,2014-04-30,"I loved this scent when I smelled it at the store and decided to buy it, so I ordered it online.  I did read the other customer reviews, saw the complaints and took my chances and ordered it anyway.  The reason?....I have other Yankee Candles with subtle smells like Clean Cotton and while it's not overly strong, if you burn it long enough, it fills your house with a wonderful smell.  So, I thought this would be the same.  It's not!  I burnt it for 4 hours and even left and came back and still couldn't smell it.  Usually when you walk in from outdoors, you can smell things better. Not the case here.  I read a response that a Yankee Candle customer service rep sent to one bad review saying that the company tries to cater to different customers, some of whom don't want strong candles.  I get that, but this should be put under the category of ""alternative light source"" rather than a candle with an aroma (which is what you expect from YC) because this candle isn't subtle, it's non existent.  I really wish the company would listen to the reviews and add more scent to this candle because it truly is a fabulous smell (if you stick your nose right in the top of the unlit candle for a sniff).  If it were stronger, it would be one of my staple candles.  I stock up on the the ones I like.  YC, please notify me if anything changes with this candle because I'll be it's number one fan."
5,2017-12-17,Love this candle.  Leave top off and it fills up the room with peonys without evening being lit!
3,2022-05-28,"Just a little to expensive for a candle ,but smells great !"
5,2019-09-14,This smells amazing
5,2019-05-30,"Clean scent, nice color."
5,2019-08-16,Smells great!
5,2016-11-05,A true lavender aroma-just like the scent in my backyard. Wish that it be re-issued without any blends (ie lavender vanilla etc)
5,2016-04-24,Great product. One can never go wrong with a Yankee Candle. The scent and life of the candle is second to none.
3,2019-04-02,This scent was not very strong. Burnt great but wouldn’t by this one again.
5,2020-01-19,Mostly the scent. I don’t like that it gone.
4,2022-07-12,i would like to buy again
2,2019-06-29,My candle was broken when I received it! I was devastated...
1,2019-06-20,"this has no detectable scent whatsoever, very disappointed considering the price"
5,2019-04-14,"Good scent, reasonably potent"
3,2022-02-26,"What happened to Yankee Candle fresh-cut roses scent candles? They used to smell wonderful. Now they smell like soap! I put off buying this because of the expense, and now I'm sorry I bought it at all. I don't want my bedroom smelling like a soapy bathtub. I want an authentic rose-scented candle -- not soap with a wick stuck in it."
4,2018-03-07,"The perfect spring scent. I purchased one and within the next day, ordered another so I won't run out for a while. It was carefully packaged in a fitting candle holder so there was no damage. It's fragrant without being overpowering or too faint."
3,2018-06-01,"Mine arrived with broken glass, but I used it anyway. Terrific scent."
4,2021-01-28,"When I first unboxed it all I could smell was the candle, but when I lit up and had it on for awhile the smell wasn't as strong as I thought and it didn't fill my room. I have a tiny room too. The smell stood mostly in the area  I left it at."
5,2012-08-20,I loooove this candle!  It smells great!  Too bad Yankee Candle has discontinued this scent...I don't know why. =/  It smells exactly like fresh flowers and saturates throughout my house!
1,2019-10-07,I today received the Yankee Candle Wedding Day Candle however the picture on the front was not as illustrated - it was gold / yellow and color and appears to be an older version of the candle I ordered (see pic above which is light and airy looking).Thank you
3,2021-03-22,To pricey
1,2018-03-20,Very faint fragrance. Will not order this fragrance again.
5,2021-03-01,Highly recommended
3,2019-01-04,The smell wasn’t even strong enough
5,2019-06-27,Pleasing scent which lasts as goes through its long burn
3,2018-02-13,Not as strongly scented as I was expecting for Yankee Candles.  Still enjoyable.
5,2016-03-25,Walked into my house one day and it smelled just like potpourri. Only a few hours later while Im writing this review did I realize that the candle was what gave the smell off.
5,2019-02-12,Love love love the smell. And i don’t like florals.
5,2018-12-09,I bought this for a co workers birthday.
5,2019-07-22,Like it
5,2018-04-25,This scent is amazing!
5,2018-12-26,Perfect and a great price for these
2,2018-12-02,"As others warned, this version of the candle just doesn’t smell as strong as you would expect. I don’t know if it’s old or a fake or what, but I’ve seen other lavender Yankee candles and this one is a fraction of the smell."
3,2021-03-24,"Perhaps the candle I got was an anomaly but the scent, thought true to lilac, is so strong that I can only have it lit for about 30 minutes before it has blanketed the house with an overwhelming scent. I guess it will last longer this way but it is inconvenient and unexpected."
5,2018-12-06,"It's Yankee, pretty much always on point!"
5,2019-01-15,I can get Yankee candles at Meijers cheaper
2,2016-05-22,"Weak  scent.  The candle has been sweating when I got it so it was hard to light.  The glass was also broken, but not the products fault."
5,2015-11-09,Onling Garden Center Value True Rose.  I love the smell of Roses at least these don't die they just burn. I would buy them again but a little biger
5,2013-01-03,"I love Yankee Candle Company.  I've tried so many different candles over the years, but this brand seems to get a hold of a smell of what's listed on the lable and not what you're washing your clothes with (that soapy, detergent smell).I ordered this Honeysuckle and it is great for aroma therapy, as well as to eliminate odor.  It is a light, pretty smell.  I recommend it if that is what you're looking for."
3,2018-02-07,Love the smell but to expensive.
5,2018-01-11,Bought these as wedding gifts for our parents on our big day and they were perfect.
3,2013-09-18,I love Yankee Candle but this smells like white roses and baby powder. This is a bit overpriced as well for what you are getting. It burns down faster than I had imagined.
5,2019-01-24,Smells great doesn’t over power
5,2013-05-03,This has always been my favorite scent from yankee.  Very distictive CLEAN fresh scent.  Always a great gift for any bride to go along with her shower gift.  Hard to find at the stores though.
2,2014-09-04,"I was looking for a scent that would be more floral and less soapy.  Ironically, the soap I purchased has just the scent I was looking for and this candle doesn't."
1,2020-11-06,"The candle had melted in the past and settled into the lid, wick nowhere to be seen. It is unusable."
5,2018-01-06,Really nice scent that lingers for 2 days after burning for only a couple of hours.
5,2017-08-16,This has a very nice rose smell.  Nothing fake about it.
1,2014-12-06,"I purchased 2 Wedding Day Yankee Candles and they do not smell at all like the ones I have purchased from Yankee.I have always loved the scent of the Wedding Day candle and know it very well. These smelled like an odd vanilla mixed with something I can not place. Since Yankee Candle put this scent in their treasure chest, so its only available at certain times. I'm assuming these have just been sitting around for a long time. I will say the products did arrive quickly and well packaged."
3,2022-08-11,A little disappointed in the amount of fragrance It doesn't make the whole room smell good like most of the Yankee Candles do.
5,2010-02-13,This candle smells exactly like what the label says: lilac blossoms.  The scent is not overwhelming and is adequate for the size of room I use it for (20x40).
5,2019-03-29,"Great scent, long lasting"
4,2013-06-17,"Reading the reviews is what prompted me to buy this candle. I always have some kind of candle burning in my house. It does smell pretty close to the fresh cut roses but not 100% spot on. I enjoy burning it pretty much all day long, but I have to say that scent throw is not very strong. My home office (where I have it) is about 10' x 10' and that is only where I can detect the scent. If I go into the living room, I can't smell it anymore. I have purchased Sladkin candles in the past and being a bit more expensive, they smell a lot stronger, making them a lot more economical, not having to burn them all the time. So the verdict is you get what you pay for. Fair."
4,2012-10-29,"I would have given this 5 stars,but, it does not smell like a Gardenia.I should know because I have Gardenia bushes in my backyard.It does have a sweet smell."
4,2020-07-15,I ordered two different Yankee Candles of the same size. They arrived in two different sized boxes with packing that was supposed to prevent breakage. The whole top lip was broken into many pieces. Most of the breakage was above the wax line so I kept it since I had another container that I could sit it in to burn.
5,2018-02-27,Came in without any breaks or cracks. Smells amazing and I love the jar!Will be repurchasing!
1,2018-06-26,I could not smell anything. I was seriously disappointed.
1,2017-10-31,Candle is old and has lost a lot of the fragrance.expected better quality for yankee candle.
4,2021-02-16,"Disappointed in the scent. Used it in my office at home, a small space so expected more scent, less smoke.It set off my smoke alarm with the office door open. I noticed the wick burns with a larger than usual flame."
5,2019-04-03,I love the candle.
5,2017-09-06,The best Yankee ever. Love the fragrance. Delivered promptly and in perfect condition
5,2015-01-02,Wow!  The smell of roses is awesome and this candle really puts it out there.  I have a large room so we like the scent to fill it!
1,2016-01-06,I love Yankee candles but I think I was sent a fake one. There is NO lavender smell at all....just smells like wax :( very disappointed!
5,2015-09-03,Fast shipping and the candle was just as advertised. The rose scent is amazing. Like all candles trim the wick to 1/8 inch and burn four hours to start.  Certainly will be buying from this seller again. Thank you!!
5,2019-01-27,I love honeysuckle
5,2013-07-14,"Exactly what I expected! The candle smells exquisite, provided you love the scent of roses! The candle came on the day it was promised, no complaints....very satisfied!"
3,2018-03-20,Smells good in the jar but you can barely smell it when it’s lit.
5,2019-01-15,Great gift for my grandma
3,2021-02-05,"I ordered three of these because of the amazing price. I LOVE yankee pink sands. However, if this is a real Yankee candle, it has to be very old. It hardly has a scent at all. I’m sending two of them back and maybe the one I burned if they’ll take it. So disappointed. I guess you get what you pay for. Giving an extra star for the fast shipping"
5,2018-03-02,"Very nice sweet scent, not overpowering. I love a lidded candle."
3,2022-02-23,"The smell is ok, not as strong as  with a different brand candle. The problem is the wick, there is only one, not enough for a large candle. The only part that burns is the center, there is a lot of un -used candle left when the burning is done. What a waste of candle and money. Will not purchase again."
5,2018-10-01,Love this scent!!!!!! Light and fruity.
4,2020-09-10,"Ok so I blind bought this candle... Turns out I hate the smell of lilac. Besides that, candle burned evenly and had a very strong scent throw for the short time I had it lit before realizing I hated the scent. Scent is VERY strong. If you like lilac, go crazy man, not my cup of tea."
5,2017-02-27,"Beautiful, potent fragrance, but not overpowering. Love to burn this candle in the evening while relaxing."
5,2020-09-20,Long lasting scent — really smells like lilacs! Love it!
1,2017-10-27,"Just got my candle, it's melted!  Being it's October it's surprising. Can't use it at all. Very disappointed!"
2,2019-04-08,"Burns too quickly, scent hardly noticeable."
2,2017-03-15,"This candle has almost no scent. I could smell the familiar scent (I've purchased several candles in the scent over time, but not recently) when about 2"" from the flame, but that was it. As I've written in other reviews, Yankee Candles have lost their scent over the last few years. I've tried to give them up but am doing so kickn' and scream'n. Have tried other brands. Can smell them, thankfully, but they don't have the nice burn of a good ole Yankee Candle. Don't know why YC is reducing the fragrance like this.Used to really enjoy ""Beach Walk,"" when it had a scent throw."
3,2016-09-20,"I love this candle's scent, but one of my candle jars was broken, almost cutting me when I lifted it out of the box."
5,2018-07-24,Great as always!
5,2014-06-15,"I love this candle! I rarely buy Yankee candles, I am very peticular aboutcandles but I just LOVE THIS SCENT!  It burns well, leaves no residue and the scent lingers nicely."
1,2009-11-13,"Because of the undersized wick, the flame is never large enough to generate much smell.  The tiny flame consumes so little wax that, over time, it merely burns a whole down through the center of the candle, leaving a 3/4-inch thick layer of wax all the way around the inside of the glass container.  While I've had some really good Yankee candles, this one is definitely not worth the money and may be my last from this company."
5,2018-01-21,"My favorite scent from Yankee Candle. Warm, toasty, sweet smelling."
5,2020-05-22,Package came but the delivery just threw the package and could have broken the candle.
3,2018-05-08,"This was on sale so the price was great but it doesn’t smell as much as higher-end candles. If purchased at full price, it would not have been worth it."
5,2018-06-15,"What can I say, Yankee Candle makes a great candle."
5,2020-02-06,"Best of the best !! Yankee candles are the best , without a doubt"
5,2011-02-04,"This was a Christmas gift and it was well received. I liked it enough to want one for myself! And to my surprise, this candle was slightly sparkly. Not too much-just right."
5,2018-10-06,"Love the multi wick candles, they burn even and smell great!"
4,2014-02-06,This is a nice rose scent that is fairly true. I like the red color too. I've tried most of Yankee Candles' floral scents and this is one of my favorite.
5,2017-08-12,This smell reminds of Summer trips to the lake and Summer camp! love it!
5,2019-01-16,Amazing scent of lavender
5,2018-11-06,Purchased for my daughter
5,2019-01-09,"This was a gift. She very much liked the candle. Loved the scent.  Loves candles, so I can see me doing business with you again."
3,2022-06-02,The candle arrived smashed to bits.I was unable to procure a replacement.The scent seemed nice. I guess.
4,2019-02-23,It was okay
4,2014-11-02,I love Yankee Candles! This is my favorite sent. But to be honest going through the Yankee Candle co. It self is cheaper and packaged better.
4,2011-10-28,"I love the smell of lilac, and was pleased to see that Yankee Candle displays the true scent instead of mixing it with another scent."
1,2018-05-16,"You smell nothing, it's a plain wax candle."
3,2022-04-26,I’ve been buying this candle for years off Amazon and the scent and quality has declined. I just opened one of my older packages and the smell was amazing vs the new one that you could barely smell and doesn’t last long at all. The coloring was completely different. I’ve gone back to ordering directly from Yankee Candles.
1,2021-02-27,"Just burned with no scent at all, I have used yankee candles in past and I loved it but not this one."
5,2019-07-22,Great product great price
5,2017-04-03,This is the best candle to overcome the winter blues!
1,2016-08-14,"Do not buy. This is described as a two wick candle. As you can see from the photo this is only a single wick candle. It does not have the silver top as in the description photo; rather, it has the glass top."
5,2016-07-18,Love the smell of this candle. Wish I could get the air freshening spray. Seems they don't have it no more.  Bummer.
5,2016-11-30,Smells amazing if you like Jasmin.Nothing like some of the terrible toilet spray out there.
5,2019-02-21,Great
5,2013-08-27,love the lavender smell in my home it also helps me get to sleep faster relaxing me.  I burn about n hour before bed and the bedroom smells great all night
5,2019-03-21,"Great price! Love yankee candle, great company!"
5,2015-09-26,"Should have better shipping,ours leaked all over the rest of our shipment,but its still the best aroma you could imagine."
5,2011-10-07,"I absolutely love this candle.  My brother bought it for my mom last year and he wanted to keep it.  So, I got it for him for xmas this year.  I wish I could keep it. ;)"
4,2021-04-19,Yankee candle does last a long time and smell does not fade. But this smell was not for me - still recommend if you like the smell. Hard to tell if smell is good over the internet haha
5,2012-12-16,"Yankee candles has always been great candles, pleasant fragrance which makes the entire room pleasant. If you like aroma therapy these candles do the job."
5,2015-11-13,lovely fragrance.  candle is very sentimental to me and hard to find in my area so I'm happy to be able to get it here .
5,2018-11-29,Love it
5,2018-07-03,Got this as a gift for my mother and she was very happy with it. It smells just like the real thing.
4,2019-03-26,"I haven't bought Yankee Candles in years because I thought they smoked too much, so I decided to try them again after reading about this scent in a magazine.  I would have rated it a little lower because it still smokes even if you trim the wick, but I really love the scent. It's a nice fresh and sweet fragrant smell that will suit any room."
4,2017-05-16,It has a very light scent.  I like this but I would prefer a stronger scent.
1,2018-03-11,"Smelled fine, but the one I received had clearly already been burned a few times. Did not realize I was buying a ""used"" candle!"
5,2018-01-16,Smells amazing!
4,2017-06-23,I really like the scent. It it is very light and not enough to flavor the room.
3,2018-06-22,"I bit strong, unpleasant for me."
5,2018-09-11,Wonderful scent
4,2022-07-12,"I really liked the candle and it's appearance overall. However, the smell was a bit too strong for me. Lasts well though!"
4,2022-06-05,This scented candle is just fantastic!! It lasts a really long time and the fragrance really permeates the entire house!
5,2015-06-17,Smells absolutely delicious. There are no candles that can beat a Yankee candle as far as the smell and the way they last.
4,2022-05-03,Does a Yankee candle ever disappoint? Bought on sale and gifted them. Girls were happy
5,2019-12-27,The scent is so relaxing
5,2020-01-24,All products great.
5,2019-12-27,Great smell exactly as pictured
5,2018-05-16,Very nice strong smell of lavender
3,2013-08-27,"It's a great candle, but for the price, I wish it would last a little longer than it did.  I would buy again, but the price has to be right."
4,2021-11-03,These are my favorite candles.  I get alot of compliments on how you can smell it thru the house. Buying more for holiday gifts
5,2019-01-13,It was an amazing gift
5,2021-04-09,Wish the smell was stronger
1,2019-03-01,No huele a nada
5,2012-05-13,Sometimes the lavendar can overwhelm the vanilla in a candle. This candle the vanilla was more evident making it not as strong. Nice pleasant smell.
5,2017-09-15,Beautiful scent - is not as strong as most Yankee candles.
1,2020-04-09,The candle I received has zero sent. I’m so dissatisfied with this purchase. I’ve never in all my years had a Yankee candle with zero throw .
3,2022-05-24,"This candle smells amazing and lasts. However, even with trimming the wicks way down before every use it leaves soot everywhere. Not sure what is causing it but for the price I paid for the candle I’m not happy with having to scrub after every use."
5,2018-01-03,Gave as a gift and it they very much liked it.
4,2022-02-09,They must only use minimal oils to scent the candle- it’s nice but only until it’s half way burned….
5,2018-04-23,great buy and love the smell
5,2012-11-26,Favorite smell in the world and Yankee Candle nailed it once again.  Even being on the other side of the country it's just a light away from making me feel at home again.
4,2018-08-18,Very nice candle.
2,2021-09-08,"This is my favorite candle scent from Yankee and I was excited to find it on here since all of Yankees’ locations are closed now. I was taken aback by the price, since $30 is a lot for a candle, but I bought them anyway because I know I’d never be able to find them elsewhere. I come back to Amazon a week later only to see the price has dropped by $11 back down to the reasonable store price. I will be returning the ones I bought and will no longer purchase from this seller. I don’t like feeling I’ve been taken advantage of."
5,2018-12-25,Awesome gift
3,2019-12-24,Smells great when you’re right on top of it but the scent doesn’t fill the room as I’d hoped it would.
4,2015-06-10,scent doesn't seem to be very powerful which is what you expect from yankee candles but it's fine. does the job.
3,2018-05-22,Needs to have a stronger scent.
4,2013-01-08,"In my world it doesn't hold that if a little is good, a lot must be better, so I like a scent that is fragrant but not overpowering; and of course any review of scents is completely dependent on personal taste. I rarely burn candles anymore, instead opting for my candle warmer, and I found this White Gardenia candle to be a pleasant  approximation of gardenia without being obnoxiously sweet. With the candle warmer I have only to flip a switch, and in minutes I can fill a room with a touch of gardenia, and several rooms within the hour. I like that."
5,2013-01-24,this is one of my favorite candles. it truly smells like fresh roses and i would buy more as soon as this one if gone. that could be very soon.
5,2015-01-02,Great aroma and nice jar.  It is strong enough to fill the room but not too much to irritate.  We like the clean scent.
5,2019-07-17,got this on great deal. smells lovely.
4,2020-07-19,Busted glass . So disappointed in deliveryI doubt it was broken when it left the warehouse. I thought I accidentally ordered something else because of the jinglingDo not put in bigger boxes !The other arrived just fine
3,2018-05-11,"Very light scent, hard to feel"
4,2013-12-05,"Really good, smell great and burn better then their smaller cousins.  This part is just filler to get in the required word count"
5,2020-02-09,My girlfriend loved it
5,2016-03-08,yankee candle has been scenting my home for years lilac is divine smells like a fresh lilac tree
5,2012-12-14,few things smell like what the label says this does.  My wife and I love these never smelled anything closer to a rose that wasn't a rose.
5,2014-09-26,We are so happy for this product.  It was exactly what I expected from the product description and it works beautifully.
5,2018-01-02,Gave as gift.  She loved the fragrance.
5,2018-07-30,smells wonderful
5,2017-04-10,Faint rose fragrance very good
4,2014-02-01,This is a true to Jasmine scent. As with all Yankee Candles bear in mind these are not highly fragrant candles.
4,2020-08-26,This is my first Yankee Candle purchase and I'm very happy with the purchase.  It looks great smells great and burns nicely.  No wick issues or deformities in the wax like some of the pictures I saw in the reviews.
5,2018-01-23,Smells wonderful and great price
4,2021-12-01,Smells so good. You can literally just remove the lid and the candle give off a beautiful aroma for a small space.
5,2016-05-20,Absolutely wonderful rose smell. Best of all candle burns evenly in jar so it doesn't create holes in the wax
3,2021-07-10,"It smelled like lilac at first, but then it started to smell more like hay. So if you like that smell, great. Plus these candles smoke a ton when you put them out, even more than this double wick candle we have. For all the hype about these candles, we just thought they'd be better. Not terrible, but not great either."
4,2021-12-23,I got this for my boss as a secret Santa gift. It’s great but the packaging is a little damaged.
1,2020-02-08,"While candle is burning, there is absolutely no scent emitting from candle.  A little scent emits when you blow the candle out. Need to find something else."
5,2019-05-09,Love this scent.  Excellent service
1,2017-10-03,Arrived shattered. I was very disappointed. I won't purchase Yankee Candles online again.
3,2021-12-24,"The packaging was really well done. However, I am quite disappointed at this product as the smell is really faint and it takes a lot of effort to identify that any scent is even there."
2,2021-10-02,"I grew up with fresh lilac bushes and have always enjoyed Yankee Candles (my favorites are Macintosh apple and Vanilla cupcake). I bought this expecting the same level of fragrance. While it does have a strong scent (which is why I buy the two wick candles), it doesn't smell anything like fresh lilac, rather it smells like an old lady's bathroom soap. Won't be purchasing this scent again."
5,2016-01-24,"This candle is fantastic!  Unlike other brands of candles, the scent is very strong.  It costs a little more, but you definitely get what you pay for."
5,2018-06-19,smells great
1,2021-07-03,The candle had very little scent when listed.  Disappointed.
5,2018-07-05,This candle catches the smell of fresh cut grass better than any other!!! Not to heavy not to light just perfect!!
5,2018-07-03,Wonderful scent
5,2016-10-23,"if you want a candle that smells exactly like sunscreen, this is for you."
5,2013-10-19,I love yankee candle because the scent is so strong and I can re use the jars! The fresh cut roses smells wonderful!
5,2014-11-19,"This item was packaged in a way to prevent any possible breakage, and the candle smells wonderful."
5,2018-03-19,This is a lovely scent!
3,2020-11-16,"I usually just attempt to find the best deal on YC large jars that I can as I mostly enjoy the warm glow of a candle and am not all that particular about scent. HOWEVER, this one smells VERY floral. Not bad if you enjoy that scent but I don't care for it. It's strong. Of course after a few lights it will fade so not overly bothered but doubt I'll be buying this one again."
1,2018-03-19,"I must have received an really old or defective candle. This is my favorite Yankee Candle scent, but this one had no smell at all. I threw it out after a few uses."
5,2019-06-17,Smell.
5,2016-11-24,I absolutely love this candle...wI'll be purchasing it again.
5,2018-01-19,Friend loved it as a gift
4,2020-03-07,"Great scent, nice than many of my Dyptique candles.  Gave as part of a housewarming gift, friends love it too!"
5,2018-02-28,Smells Beautiful.
3,2011-05-20,I was a little disappointed to be honest with the scent of this candle...just didn't seem strong enough  Especially for the price paid.
1,2020-10-06,Opened the box to use it today and it was completely messed up. I can’t even get to the wick. It’s useless.
5,2021-12-22,Like the scent all over my apartment
5,2020-10-02,Can never go wrong with yankee smells great and last long.
1,2018-05-02,Expensive for a candle
4,2021-05-15,"This Yankee Candle burns slowly and will last quite a while. And that's good. The scent while sweet, pleasant, and powerful enough to fill a fairly large room does not smell much like lavender. So, would I buy Yankee Candle again, yes. Going forward I will buy Yankee whenever I can afford to. Would I buy this particular scent again? Probably not. (My favorite is Midnight something)"
1,2020-07-17,The smell was pungent and it made me feel dizzy. Totally unusable!!! Terrible product!
5,2014-12-08,"Love this fragance and couldn't find in store. Thank God for Amazon, who also had it cheaper than I originally paid in store! :) most pleased!!!"
5,2016-09-20,I am well pleased with my purchase.  I would recommend this seller.
5,2013-01-04,the candle smells just like fresh cut roses. I am just delighted with this company. Any one thinking of trying it should!
5,2015-05-03,My favorite fragrance. It also helps your inside air problem if you have animals.
2,2021-08-14,"I have always loved yankee candles but this one is disappointing. Lavender/Vanilla but can’t smell it at all. The glass jar seems to have some sort of white cloudy film covering the inside, tried washing it off but still isn’t a clear glass like my other candles. Hopefully the scent is better as it burns down some. I hate having to return items, it’s a hassle. Will have to stick to buying in store/in person for future."
4,2022-01-19,"Great smell, but doesn't burn the best and doesn't last too long for the price."
5,2018-04-09,Love the flavor.
5,2018-02-12,Smells delicious.
4,2021-07-04,Great candle for a larger space. I didn’t like the scent but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great product. I gave it to a friend who loves it. I mistook it for another beach scent.
5,2019-08-01,"I'm biased because this is my favorite smell, but the candles do last a long time."
5,2018-12-09,No
1,2021-03-20,"Yankee Candle has always been my favorite company. For obvious reasons. Lol. My two all time favorite scents are Blooming Jasmine and this Lily one. Not only did they smell amazing, they were the two strongest scents in my opinion. Over the past 3-4 years the scents have diminished.I had this candle burning a couple hours. There was a very faint smell and the wick kept blowing off black smoke. It was horrible. A shame."
5,2014-07-28,LOVE!!! these candles.  the smell is sooooo fresh and clean and summery!!!  enjoy!
1,2015-02-06,Ehh.. this scent is not what i expected. It smells like bad cologne and not jasmine
4,2022-02-16,"Great gift for anyone who likes scents and candles. I mean it's a candle, you light it and it smells nice. Also perfect if the lights go out."
5,2014-02-01,This is a very pretty rose scent. I enjoyed lighting candles in the winter. It really makes the rooms cozy.
5,2018-03-19,Nice candle
3,2020-08-06,Arrived Broken
4,2021-05-05,Smell is what exactly I though but it's not strong enough. I used to get honey suckle which is my favorite smell among these and the smell used to be strong but couldn't find any. I took one star off because of the light smell.
1,2021-03-31,It was completely shattered when sent to me. Little glass shards were everywhere inside.
4,2015-03-29,"So, I had never smelled this scent, but it was highly rated so I went with it! This candle is gorgeous, don't get me wrong, I'm just not 100% a fan of the scent (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). It's a lot sweeter than I would have thought, which is okay, but I was hoping for more of a floral scent. But still, it has a great burn time, and it an absolutely lovely pink color."
5,2016-06-12,I purchased the candle for my niece who loves the scent.
5,2015-02-03,Smells so good arrived on time secured in bubble wrap I recommend this if you're a candle person.
5,2018-01-22,Smells awesome
4,2013-08-17,"I got no reply from the receiver on this candle, when I got it, I opened the lid and it smelled like a rose."
5,2021-01-26,Love the scent
2,2015-05-12,"sorry, just doesn't smell like lilacs at all to me. seems to be a generic floral scent."
5,2014-01-23,This was purchased to give as a gift.  The receiver  loved the aroma and thought it lasted a long time.
4,2020-03-22,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 Quality as always with Yankee. There is not much of a scent, I won’t order this scent again"
3,2013-12-30,"The scent is not as great as I had hoped, especially for the price of the product, but it does the job."
1,2020-10-14,"Candle showed up melted, so unable to use.."
2,2016-12-16,"I love Jasmine smell and Yankee Candle in general. But with this one...I am not very happy. The smell is very weak and the candle consumes very quick, so not really worth it for that price."
1,2019-07-18,The package was fine but it the glass was broken
5,2019-12-16,This smells amazing and burns a really long time
5,2016-02-17,"Exactly what I was looking for, a soft smell with a lot of burn time."
5,2018-02-28,"great price, nice candles"
1,2019-11-04,This is not yankee candle. I have bought this from tjmaxx multiple times and it smells super strong!! Don't WAIST your money because this doesn't smell at all.
5,2018-03-02,nice
5,2016-11-23,It's one of my favorite yankee scents and hard to find in stores now.
3,2018-03-05,"Not quite a real true jasmine scent. It smells more artificial or perfume-like. If you are looking for a true jasmine scent I highly suggest Shortie’s Candles in the Jasmine scent:https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00U8IRRIC/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1520217151&sr=8-5&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=jasmine+candle+shorties&dpPl=1&dpID=41cmueB%2BCRL&ref=plSrch They are soy candles scented with pure essential oils and are much better smelling, cleaner burning, and less expensive."
5,2019-03-03,Good price and fast shipping
5,2018-01-28,I gave this as a gift... the person loved it
5,2017-07-17,lady seems to enjoy it
5,2021-04-01,Best scent I've ever smelled
5,2017-12-06,Smells divine!
5,2014-01-09,This Fresh Cut Roses candle was one of several I bought and had a wonderful aroma. I would buy it again.
3,2018-05-22,Scent was not strong enough for a room bigger than the bathroom.
5,2016-09-13,Great as always from Yankee Candle. Mom loves it.
5,2014-04-26,"I ordered the wrong scent, looking for Dune Grass, but pleasantly surprised by the scent.  Glad I like it since I bought five, LOL."
5,2017-01-16,I wish this scent hadn't been retired. I love it.
5,2016-08-23,"Love the smell, just like fresh cut roses!  Will order again!"
1,2018-02-06,"What can I say. There are candles with strong scent, good scent, bad scent and weak scent... but this one has NO SCENT AT ALL, and I mean it.I already had candles with very weak scent but always read reviews, where people wrote about no scent... now I know. This one has no scent whatsoever, not even if you hold your nose in it. As I bought it from Europe, sending it back is just to much effort, so I'm burning it down, to get the jar. Stay away from this one. Yankee should give refund for these candles."
5,2018-02-12,Great candles.
4,2020-09-16,I purchased this for a Christmas gift and as I was removing it from the container - the lid was not on tight and it hit the floor and broke!  I had to reorder one.
3,2022-03-19,Nice container but be aware the wick is very long and left unattended or not cut back could start a fire. When first lit all I smelled was burning wax. After about an hour I could smell the LIGHT scent of lillac. Not worth the price!!!
5,2017-12-16,Good quality!
5,2017-08-01,Best candle out there
5,2021-01-04,They arrived quickly and all in perfect condition.
4,2018-02-08,"Delivery was fast! These are some of the best longest lasting candles. The scent is beautiful, I wish a little stronger. I’ve bought this scent before and I do believe it was stronger more heavily scented."
5,2017-02-10,Love it!
4,2021-03-17,Candle scent is a personal preference. I love lilacs but I think this scent is just a little too strong. Still enjoyable overall though.
1,2020-05-28,Product came completely smashed. I’ve reached out via email twice and no response. Very disappointed
4,2022-04-20,Excellent quality for the price quoted.
5,2016-02-24,fabulous. strong fragrance and true to the honeysuckle smell. I love it!!!
5,2018-04-24,VERY NICE SMELL
4,2018-12-17,I love Yankee Candle.  They just last & last.  Well worth the price.
5,2010-12-13,"I've smelled many candles that claimed to have a ""fresh rose scent"", but I have to say that this candle really lives up to its name. If you love the smell of roses or potpourri, this is the candle for you."
5,2017-06-05,wonderful scent ..
1,2020-10-14,Don’t buy this candle.Candle has no smell.Similar candle which I bought in store has strong smell.
4,2022-08-13,Good scent
1,2021-04-18,Barely any scent!
2,2016-05-28,"Love the scent, way overpriced. Didn't think to check oh big 7 ounces was"
5,2016-08-07,Yankee candles never let one down. This high quality jasmine candle fills the room with sweet tranquil scent. It is a perfect for creating a romantic atmosphere.
5,2015-01-01,I love rose smelling candles and they are hard to find.  This one is perfect!
3,2021-02-05,"Wow, I'm shocked. I have been buying the equivalent, off-brand.. Tuscany and Village candles, and I just purchased my first yankee candle in ages... and wow they are horrible compared to the other two. The scent is well enough, but it burns 3 times as fast, literally! I'll never buy a Yankee candle again."
5,2016-03-18,this is my favorite yankee scent.  great price also.
5,2016-12-22,"very nice quality, would buy again"
2,2022-06-20,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 The scent per every other Yankee Candle I've bought is awesome! It wasn't giftable due to the wick being black and the wax build up on the sides. Other than that it's a lovely addition for myself and I enjoy the scent."
1,2017-09-02,glass arrived smashed in the box and is unusable. would recommend going to the store and buying one
4,2017-04-04,"This candle is genuine Yankee Candle. It filled my room with a lovely light smell. I wouldn't say it's exactly like roses, it does have a strange ""after-smell"" which I would compare to must. However, this item was on sale when I purchased it, so I would say for the price, I am satisfied."
5,2012-12-30,Beautifully fragrant candle that is what has come to be expected from Yankee.Love it.  Very strong and long burning candle.
5,2011-05-16,"Lovely, long lasting scent, candle burned daily for eight-ten hours and lasted nearly two weeks, never lost fragrace and one candle easily scented 400 sqare feet."
5,2012-09-10,"This candle has such a soft, soothing scent.  It reminds me of being at a spa.Great product!  Always love Yankee Candles..no other brand compares."
2,2020-07-24,"If you look back I ordered several candles and all came in perfect condition.however this one was broken and can hear the glass in the box.  It was packaged good, no dents on the box so I can only thing that it was dropped by someone prior to me receiving.  I kept this candle since the glass that was broken was at the top and candle could still be used.On a positive note...the candle smell wonderful and scent does carry a long way.Thank you,Tamara Galindo"
3,2021-08-02,Mine came melted sideways with the wick completely covered so I had to bake it and fish out the wick. Wish they shipped it facing up so that wouldn't happen but it's always packed laying sideways. Not sure if it melted in their warehouse or during shipping but I left it in the sun to try to melt it back into shape and it didn't work so I resorted to the oven. Kind of wasteful to burn it just to fix it.
5,2017-03-20,as described and arrived on time
5,2017-02-27,"Love the Lavender smell, makes our home smell lovely!"
4,2022-06-04,Great
5,2018-08-07,Love the smells
2,2021-11-30,Looks crusty on top and color is not consistent. Bought for a gift but I would be embarrassed to give it looking like this. When I order from Amazon I don’t expect to receive seconds but it seems to be a thing.
3,2016-03-29,Yankee Candles used to be the best.  They still are excellent but other candle makers are just as good while Yankee is still commanding a premium price.  The other makers are priced much more competitively; often half the Yankee price.  I won't name them here because that would make me look like a pitchman for them and I am not.  Look around.  I am a huge fan of the newer soy waxes in jar candles.
4,2021-02-16,In past I’ve enjoyed the Yankee Candles for longevity and scent. This candles scents was vague and short lasting :(.
5,2017-04-02,Very nice scent.
4,2022-08-06,Everything
4,2015-01-16,This is my grandson's favorite Yankee Candle scent and i bought it for him.
5,2016-09-06,"Nice candle, would buy again!"
5,2016-12-12,A great Wedding Gift.
5,2018-05-07,Loce the smell
5,2019-12-12,"Love, Love, Love Yankee Candles"
5,2016-12-30,couldn't be happier
1,2015-07-23,does not smell like cut grass.  smelled like oil base paint
5,2017-04-13,Great smelling
5,2019-08-25,Fabulous
2,2020-07-06,"I have gardenias growing at my house, along the rear lanai.  They smell amazing when in bloom.  My lady friend always comments on how good they smell.  I thought I would buy this White Gardenia scented Yankee Candle as a gift for her.  While this candle has a pleasant smell It doesnt smell like real gardenias at all really.  To me it smells more like a clean laundry scented air freshener or something...  I likely will just end up buying real potted gardenias for her and probably return this."
5,2016-10-14,"Strong, wonderful scent."
5,2019-04-20,Very big on scent. Love aromatherapy. This candle is smells amazing!
4,2020-09-16,All of the wax was melted to one side of the jar. Had to re melt it to get to the wicks. Otherwise this is a very strong scented candle which we love.
5,2016-08-26,"Fast shipping, great product!"
4,2017-12-11,Smells Good
5,2019-02-02,Very good
1,2018-06-17,There was not any throw whatsoever.I threw it in the trash and tried fresh cut roses instead.That one was a winner. I highly recommend fresh cut roses.Do not waste your money on True Rose.
3,2022-03-05,I was surprised that this yankee candle didn’t produce any scent at all. Usually they are very nice but this one had little scent . I’m not really sure why? I really would like my money back.
1,2021-08-01,I bought this as a lightning steal for $11 so I thought I’d get a nice candle but this is a super small one. Should of cost half the price.
4,2017-10-06,"It smelled SOOOO good, but the smell went away after about 8 hours of burning. It also didn't burn evenly, and left alot of wax and the wick ended up burning out before half the candle was done. Pretty disappointing for such an expensive candle, but that scent was unbeatable. Probably going to get a scentsy of this scent, if I can."
5,2018-07-17,I just wish these cost less!
5,2016-09-26,Best smelling Rose candle!
3,2018-06-18,no scent throw. Just meh.
2,2015-07-08,True rose should have little stonger scent to it.
5,2016-01-01,Very strong rose scent! Happy with purchase
5,2017-03-25,Love the smell!
3,2017-12-20,Can't bash the product as it smells great but the glass was broken around the candle. Real shame because it smells sooo good.
5,2015-09-14,My sisters favorite scent. Reminds us of summer.
5,2015-12-18,I love this scent.  I buy it all the time.
5,2018-08-01,Good
5,2015-02-11,Smells just like roses and not to strong or over powering.
4,2022-02-10,Good as expected thank you!
5,2019-04-02,Lovely
1,2020-08-23,Brought one of these candles it came broken in the mail didn’t even get to use it
3,2020-07-15,"This candle arrives today with whole top broken due to it being shipped in a flimsy recycled cardboard clamshell with no padding. Candle is fine, so I decided that it was easier to burn it down to below the sharp broken edges that it was to return it during Covid. So here we are.Good candle, strong scent. But glass needs padding, which I’m sure a candle manufacturer knows well,"
5,2018-04-27,Yankee candles are the best.
4,2015-09-21,It lasts longer than the cheaper ones at WM!
4,2021-02-05,"Compared to other Yankee Candles the scent isn’t very strong, but it is pleasant and lasts a very long burn time."
5,2015-03-23,Love this smell like fresh flowers
5,2015-02-28,Smells like night jasmine.  Wonderful.  'Nuf said.
4,2019-09-19,Smells nice but price is high
5,2021-02-08,Love it smells great
3,2022-05-21,Came BROKEN INSIDE OF THE PACKAGING
5,2017-03-09,"Great shipping time, product was exactly what i wanted."
5,2015-02-16,"Wonderful smell and lasts for hours, very relaxing!"
4,2021-05-15,"Wish the smell were stronger and a bit more florally. Smells like gardenia, but not quite like what I'm used to. Burns nicely. Will try a different brand though for future gardenia-scented candles."
2,2015-08-06,Did not have an accurate or lasting scent.
3,2015-03-21,got here broken ! like the smell of pink sands but could not use .
1,2020-04-13,"Very weak throw scent. Smells great, but when lit there is almost no throw scent. Waste of money."
3,2022-05-03,"This candle evokes a smell of smoke for me not sure what was happening. I've ordered, currently have other's Yankee candles...this smell doesn't work for me."
5,2016-02-20,Bought as a gift and she was very pleased.
5,2017-12-18,"Smell so nice, just like the real midnight jasmine. Love it"
4,2017-12-05,Love this scent
3,2019-02-18,"Very weak scent , even upto your nose . Would not buy again."
4,2022-01-21,My mom loved it
2,2016-02-01,glass container was shattered
3,2021-03-16,"In the past, I bought Yankee candles and always very fragrant also while lit. You can only smell this one when you first take the lid off not while burning. Won't spend money on a Yankee candle ever again. I suppose their quality went down hill over the years or I got a bum one."
3,2016-04-22,ok didn't smell much
4,2015-01-09,It was a gift for myBoyfriend and he seemed to like it!
4,2013-01-18,"Yankee candles are second to none, some of the best smelling candles there are. The only problem is, this particular candle uses only one wick, which is particularly thick, and if you ever burn the candle for too long and let the wick become too long, the flame starts letting off a lot of soot, which builds up in the glass, given it's shape.However, this can easily be avoided if you don't burn the candle for more then a few hours, and have a way to clip the wick with something to cut the wick deep in the jar."
3,2015-01-22,"Love this candle, and was a good price. The shipping was an issue, since the jar was broken when it came. We just took it out of the jar, wiped the broken glass off, and use it as a free-standing candle now. Not worth the effort to return it, but you'd think they would better protect a glass item for shipping."
4,2018-05-25,It did
1,2016-04-04,do not like smell
5,2016-05-27,Smells great
5,2020-07-26,"Glass container was broken at the top when it arrived, but I made it work. Smells nice."
4,2021-02-20,Ive never bought it before having huge sale couldn't beat the price...wld buy again
4,2021-01-12,I got the candle on sale but the wick is not right the 🔥 goes too high doesn’t have a low flicker
5,2016-08-19,good
5,2015-05-31,Great shipping and fresh candle
5,2017-01-27,FAVE
5,2015-08-23,Yes awesome candle!Would buy again but it has already gone up in price.Funny how that works!
5,2015-03-04,Long lasting and amazing smell. Just like being in arose garden.
1,2020-04-13,This item was completely shattered. The box looked like someone drove over it.  Broken glass everywhere.
5,2014-12-23,"Smells like real roses, not chemicals"
5,2020-03-22,Great smell and is really good hiding cat urine odor.
1,2020-07-17,LAST ABOUT 20 HOURS.AT MOST.
5,2015-02-20,Sooo fragrant...it literally fills my home with scent within minutes!
4,2021-11-04,Smell great. Great gift
3,2020-08-27,"Never ordered a YC before and wanted to see what all the hub bub was about....disappointed the scent was so weak and the candle did not last very long. My $9 Better Homes & Gardens candles have stronger scents and last alot longer....oh well c'est la vie...not gonna buy another YC again, not worth it imo"
5,2016-04-22,it is the best fragrance i have
5,2016-07-18,Nice strong smell
5,2016-06-28,love it
4,2015-07-15,"I really like the ""wedding day"" sent, but actually received 1 wedding day and 1 magnolia."
5,2015-07-01,One  of my favorite scents!
5,2015-01-27,splendid fragrance
4,2020-06-18,Jar cracked right when I pulled it out of the box and set it on the table very gently .  . Hopefully it will still burn ok.  .
4,2020-12-12,"Beach Walk not my favorite scent. Too flowery for me, but still a great slow burn. Ive taken it to work lol. If you like flowers, this one is great! Still love most Yankee scents and they burn very well."
4,2021-12-09,I've used the melts in the same name brand and they smell stronger. I like the Jasmine smell and would buy this candle again as a gift for myself.
3,2022-08-14,always use Yankee candle because theyu have such lovely scents.  disappointed i  tje whte gardenia...not much scent to it.
4,2021-06-26,"The smell  is nice, but some candle wax leaked out of the jar into the shipping box.."
3,2021-03-22,It smells good but it smells nothing like lilacs. Put in a few extra dollars and buy the Lilac from B&B. If you really want the Lilac smell this is not going to smell like lilacs. Remember when Yankee Candles were supposed to be the best!
1,2021-03-13,"This candle can’t possibly be a Yankee candle as I have been purchasing them for over 20 years and all scents were wonderful, you could smell them. This particular Yankee candle “Lilac Blossom,” has little to no scent. The wax is not creamy and after the candle has cooled and solidifies after burning, the top of the candle have has bumps and or bubbles."
3,2022-04-20,I have been buying this candle local but decided to hunt them on Amazon - Purchased it and it arrived as expected but was disappointed after lighting it. It has very little smell compared to what I have been getting locally. I'm not sure if it is old stock or maybe even a fake Yankee Candle knock-off. Looks good but does not smell good...
5,2016-03-14,Great gift
5,2013-03-17,This is one of the best Yankee scents. Floral but not overly done. Smells like a perfect spring day. Candle lasts a good long while and makes my whole apartment smell fresh. Will continue to buy this Yankee Candle scent.
5,2019-03-15,Soft scent.  Not overpowering.
4,2016-02-16,Smells nice.
5,2015-02-05,smells like the real thing
5,2016-05-18,"Great product, good price."
5,2016-08-23,Wonderful scent!!
5,2015-07-19,"It's one of the best candles I've ever bought. Smells good, and you can use it for a quite long time."
5,2015-03-28,This scent reminds me of being at the beach. It made a cold winter day much brighter. I would recommend this scent if you love summer and the beach.
5,2020-03-19,Smells fantastic!
1,2019-12-21,Arrived broken
3,2022-03-06,"I was hoping a Yankee candle would have a much stronger scent, but this is very lacking. Could barely smell it even after burning for several hours."
4,2021-10-23,"Has a sweet, perfume type smell. Great for mothers day, wedding day gift, engagement gift"
4,2022-04-21,Smells like your at the beach with the copper tone scent.  Nice!!
1,2020-06-13,The worse. Doesn’t smell like anything. Very disappointed.
2,2022-07-24,"I typically LOVE this scent but their candles are just not worth it. As always, super expensive but I have other candles that are much more fragrant. I only bought these because of the prime day sale."
4,2015-09-20,It smells like a rose.
2,2022-03-15,"Does not smell anything like Night Jasmine .  I will say the candle had good burn time, but the scent was hardly noticeable.  I find better smelling candles at my local Dollar General store- really!  I wanted to like this candle, but no such luck."
4,2018-03-25,smells great
5,2014-07-14,This candle rocked my world!!
4,2015-08-30,Met expectations.
5,2015-11-24,Love!
4,2020-03-13,"It's decent. It smells mostly like lilacs, although I've found better and less-expensive lilac candles out there. It DOES last a long time."
5,2015-02-27,My wife loves it.
3,2021-01-05,"No teak smell. Very floral. Like artificial rose scent. Has a smell I cant place, like playdoh and potpourri maybe. Not at all what I thought it would be. Might be good if you like flowery smells, pass on it if you like earth, musk, and spice."
2,2022-07-06,I was so excited to get this candle at such a great price
5,2018-04-20,Absolutely beautiful fragrant
3,2018-02-01,Good!
5,2014-12-29,"Only candle I've found which genuinely smells of fresh roses, everyone else seems mixed with fruit or baby powder, and while those aren't unappealing in their own right. I just want to stop and smell the roses."
2,2014-10-04,Doesn't smell like any gardenia I have ever smelled. Smells basically like an old person or something at your grandmas house.
4,2019-02-25,I loved this candle because it does smell so good.  It will fill the room with a beautiful scent.  The only thing I don't like is that they burn so quickly and often the wick is not right in the middle.
4,2019-02-26,Just love the sent.
3,2021-01-09,"These candles smell great, but they burn-up REALLY quickly and are awfully expensive, making them of poor overall value for the money."
2,2020-12-03,These came mostly melted. They were for reception tables. Had to set them in pan of water and remelt. Retrieve the wick and watch it reset and add the wick back in. Only 1 of the 4 was good to use.Made it work. It was October in KS so not hot on day they came. Still smelled good.
5,2015-09-07,"Best scent ever! At least for Summer, :)"
5,2014-12-31,Smells great!
1,2019-08-17,"Pretty candle, but had absolutely no scent"
5,2020-02-20,Love it!
3,2018-02-28,"As others have said, it has a very light scent. I use it in my hallway since the cat box is under a table in a corner there. If you want something highly scented this isn't the candle for you. If you want something that leaves a nice light scent then you'll like it. I would suggest you use it in a small area. I might move it to the hall bathroom but it's ok. It does have a scent after all."
3,2022-03-14,I love yankee candles. This is the first scent I’ve gotten that is just off a little bit. The scent also doesn’t linger like my favorite linen scent.
2,2020-12-05,"I had ordered 2 of these one was good however the second on the jar was chipped and had a very large crack so sadly it ended up being a waste of money, soothe candle itself I have nothing bad to say however there packaging is not great so the one that was good was very expencive because one was a full waste, I would not order one again not worth the risk"
1,2018-07-03,"I enjoy yankee candles but this scent was very weak, I wouldn’t buy it again."
5,2014-10-03,Love the scent.
4,2019-04-22,They don't makebthis fragrance anymore according to some store associates. I do feel the candle is overpriced but its such a lovely fragrance I went for it. It was packaged very securely.
5,2015-06-06,Love these
5,2015-09-27,Just as I remembered.
4,2020-08-24,This was a gift for my mom and she lives the gardenia scent. I just bought her the lavender scent.
5,2015-03-19,Excellent
3,2020-10-23,It smells like literal rose petal and I don't mean the metaphorical one or the prefume-ish smells it gave me a headache. But if you want the inside to smell like dirt or outside this is for you. It's not the candles fault I didn't like it though. I just expected something different.
4,2022-06-18,"I love the product, but the only thing I have a problem with is how fast the wick burns down. When you get about 2/3 down, the wick won't stay lit because it burns down faster than the liquid wax."
2,2018-02-06,"I am very impressed by the two-wick tumbler candles. The consistent, thorough burning avoids the wasted wax found in Yankee's jar candles. That being said, I found the Island Waterfall scent to be overpowering. Unlike the pleasant natural odors I've found with other Yankee candles, this product smelled like laundry detergent."
5,2015-02-08,Love it
3,2017-06-19,My girlfriend loves these candles . It burns too quickly but it's a nice product .
5,2015-01-31,Smell good
3,2020-07-12,"Opened shipping box and broken glass fell all over. Unable to use candle. Sending a replacement within ten days, so hopefully that one will arrive undamaged.  I have bought this scent before and enjoyed it very much, so was disappointed that this one arrived broken."
5,2015-01-03,"I love yankee candles and buy them regularly, with the lavender being my favorite. This last time I ordered one it was delivered to me shattered. I filed a claim and asked for a replacement, and within a week a new one arrived at my door in perfect condition. Thank you!"
5,2019-11-07,Awsome smell
4,2016-12-21,"Product came on-time, and the product itself is always stellar. I gave 4/5 stars because the jar arrived in the box a little messy. It seems as though some of the wax escaped the jar and made a greasy mess. Fairly easy to clean up though, and the candle itself was in perfect condition, just a bit gross."
4,2020-06-23,"Scent is pretty good. It’s more subtle when burning, than when you open the jar. Overall worth the money."
3,2018-03-17,"As I’ve found with another Yankee candle that I ordered, the initial smell is absolutely amazing. This one is sweet and very clean smelling, but not overly sweet. Unfortunately they don’t burn very evenly, and the throw isn’t very good with this particular candle. If I want it to burn evenly, I’ve got to burn it the entire day, and even then I really can’t smell it."
4,2020-03-21,Smells yummy but started to burn unevenly halfway thru (couldn’t keep it lit anymore). But gorgeous and heavy for gifting!! Nice
5,2014-10-04,Great candle
5,2019-07-14,My favorite candle. Truly smells like fresh cut roses.
1,2021-06-02,"Apparently my candle didn't get the memo.  The item's description of ""Refreshing salt water and sea musk warmed with sunny notes of tangerine and orange blossom capture sunset strolls at the beach"" is *farrrrr* from what I experienced.  I don't pick up any of those scents, in fact, it smells very flowery/perfumy.  Rather than ""taking a stroll on the beach"", I feel like I'm taking a stroll through my grandma's house.  What a huge letdown, never again will I buy this scent."
1,2019-03-16,Cant smell anything
4,2021-06-08,Too light a fragrance!
2,2019-10-11,My opinion is that Yankee has gotten too comfortable with their fame and they're slacking. I bought the Pink Sand one and it has LITTLE TO NO SCENT! The only reason I have it any stars is because it's pretty when it burns and I like the color. What a bummer especially since these are so expensive. Too much hate to return a candle.
5,2014-05-28,I mean its a candle right?What possibly can go wrong other than buying a smell you dont know ;-)
1,2015-09-02,"This Candle barely smells like anything, let alone roses"
1,2014-12-30,I was hoping this would smell like a lawn; cut grass.  It smelled more like flowers.
4,2020-05-02,"Candle smells good, but the method of delivery stating: 'handed to the individual' - is simply not true. This could cause problems for other customers down the road so just keep your eyes peeled for it."
5,2016-04-07,"Smells great! Has a much better smell than the candles I've been picking up from Walgreens over the month. Much sweeter, love to burn it before sleeping as it's relaxing."
2,2021-08-09,"The aroma is of jasmine but cloyingly sweet. It unbearable to light the candle for more than a few minutes. If you are good with the artificial jasmine aroma, go for it . I would prefer if they would tone it now and get the actual essence of jasmine."
2,2022-02-07,"No, I don't have covid or it's symptoms.. my smell is quit fine.. It doesn't seem like any other Yankee candy I've purchased before. Lack of scent is an under statement.. won't purchase again.."
5,2018-04-04,As expected of yankee candles.
4,2017-01-22,loved it.
4,2018-12-11,"This candle smells great. It's not a very strong scent, but it's still a nice subtle smell. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
1,2019-07-21,Very disappointed.  It does not smell like anything at all.  Huge waste of money.
3,2019-12-29,"I love yankee candles but the smell of this lilac was not pleasing at all.  Yuck.  Hey, I normally enjoy the smell of lilac or I wouldn't have purchased it, but this one was a big no for me.  I suppose I could have gifted it but would have felt badly giving a candle that I thought smelled bad."
5,2015-08-05,Very good.
4,2016-06-05,abit too strong for my liking but smell just like Jasmine.
2,2021-03-17,"Yankee Candle Lilac Blossoms is my wife's favorite candle fragrance.  Unfortunately, the wax in this candle is old, it doesn't burn evenly and it has very little fragrance."
3,2022-04-11,I used to get these a couple years ago and the fragrance was strong. I believe they changed their mixture. Not cool
1,2019-11-12,When I got my product the glass was broken to the point where I couldn’t use the candle
5,2019-07-19,Came well packaged. Nice scent!
5,2015-09-18,"Amazing smell, long lasting, great quality."
3,2015-03-09,Weak scent.
3,2018-02-28,I like a really good scent that flows through the whole house....like bath and body works candles. These just aren't as strong and so I burn it longer and faster and it still just fills the room I am in.
2,2021-03-24,"The scent of this candle is incredibly horrible unfortunately. It smells like a piercing stinging strong floral scent that invades your nostrils.A shame because I loved the candle itself and seems to have long burn time, very weighty. But I would avoid this scent."
2,2017-11-13,The scent was not noticible. Bad batch?
4,2021-04-30,Scent is light
4,2020-08-26,I love yankee candles the pricee Ed has always been a little over priced.
4,2022-06-30,I haven’t actually burned it because it’s a gift but it smells so good. I like the jar it came in too.
4,2021-02-28,"Wife liked it,  that's it."
4,2019-07-29,"Por tener doble mecha y ser una vela grande,debería tener mayor fragancia.Tener cuidado donde la colocan porque a mi consideración,la llama que produce es un poco grande"
3,2020-12-10,"My candle arrived in 1 piece.  The scent is not as fragrant as I expected.  What was really disappointing was the color.  On the website the picture shows the candle as a vibrant lavender color.  My candle was much more muted.  Since I got it at a great price, I am not going to return it."
4,2018-02-14,"Scent was good, but not much like real roses."
1,2021-12-24,Horrible!!!  I have been buying a lot of Yankee Candles from Amazon lately because of the deals they have been having.  I bought over a dozen in the last month here but have been buying them for over 30 years.  This one just about made me gag!  It smells like rotten burnt coconut shells!  Gross!!!  I gave it a good try but will be returning it.  I love most of the others but this one is like burning rotten garbage in the back of a smoothie shop!  It smells like they let tropical fruit rot and then juiced them and added it to the wax.
2,2022-01-10,"Like their other candles, this one has impressive longevity. Unlike their other candles, this one does not smell good at all. I'll be sticking with their cupcake scented candles from now on."
4,2017-09-20,4 stars because although it's awesome and I love Yankee Candle and how they make candles for tons of occasions (I am giving this to brother and future sister-in-law). It smells strongly of roses and kinda old /dusty flowers smell.
5,2013-05-04,"This aroma is very close to the real thing. I can't imagine why the Yankee Candle people would direct this aroma to MEN in particular, when virtually everyone loves the smell of freshly cut grass.So, cudos for the aroma. Bad for directing this at only men.  I have compared this to other grass-like aromas and Yankee comes closest to the real thing.  Most others are far too sweet.  Please continue this product!"
2,2022-04-22,"Pretty candle. It is small, I like the color of the wax and the jar.  It burns level, and the wick doesn't disappear.  What I don't like is the scent. Unless I am very close to the candle, I can't smell the lavender.  I would not buy again.  It is alot of money to spend on a candle I can't smell"
3,2022-04-16,"Very hard to describe this scent, but ultimately, I found it funky.  It's not for me."
5,2016-02-19,Great product. I will order this again!
1,2021-08-02,"This scent is one I had never tried before.  Both candles gave me problems from the moment I lit them.  All wicks are trimmed daily but this morning, with about 2-3"" of wax left, they set off both my smoke alarms and I had just lit them!  I use Yankee Candle exclusively but these are going in the trash.  I will rethink further purchases and certainly never again will I purchase this particular scent."
5,2015-10-12,Positively smells like roses! Packaged great! Will buy again!
5,2013-06-02,"No surprises with Yankee candle , the quality is always the same and the smell is wonderful, arrived without any damage."
5,2014-08-07,Made a great gift for my Step-mother.
5,2013-01-19,My Wife loves the scent of all the candles make by Yankee Candle.  They are expensive for the size. But she feels these are the best scented candles.  Our House guest loves the smell when they walk into the house.
1,2018-02-05,"I did not like it, no Fragrance"
4,2021-01-11,wife loved the smell has yet to ignite it
5,2019-06-09,My favorite scent 🥰
4,2018-01-07,"Even though everyone seems to like this scent. My wife did not like it. She said that it smells like a fancy public restroom. I did like it.She has loved the other scents like Christmas cookie, sugared pumpkin, vanilla cupcake..."
3,2022-08-09,It’s a personal preference but this one was a little strong
3,2019-12-31,My favorite fragrance Fresh Cut Roses loses its smell half way through burning the large jar candle. I am switching to medium jar size as they seem to stay fragrant longer. Very disappointed in the large candle losing fragrance half way through burning the candle. Beware.
5,2015-01-04,I love this scent.
5,2016-04-19,Just as expected.
3,2021-01-09,"It is a nice candle and lasts a decent amount of time, but I was expecting a lighter scent than what it has. Some might like it, but it's too strong for me - almost a sweet smell. I definitely would not use it in a small room. The smell would be overwhelming. I would use it in larger spaces only."
4,2020-01-25,Recommend it to anyone good price that's what got me plus great smell just wish it lasted longer.
2,2019-08-04,"They are too big. Their product is typically inferior, i.e, wicks not centered, pooling, low burning flame, etc. Yankee used to produce quality candles, now they don't care, and for $21-$30, it's just not worth it. Yes, they have a huge variety of scents and other merchandise, I'm just not wasting my money on their over priced items. I don't even purchase when I get a coupon for buy 1 get 2 free."
5,2015-04-16,A wonderful fragrant candle. One of my favorites.
4,2020-04-29,Good value. Bought as a gift and the recipient really liked the scent
5,2018-10-08,Love the scent!
3,2019-04-26,"Lovely scent, but wish it were stronger."
5,2016-02-22,Nice scent. Will order again
4,2021-03-15,Smells good
5,2016-06-11,Smells clean!!! Love it!!!
5,2019-04-15,Happy with the product
4,2020-05-11,Love the smell of it but when it is burning this fragrance is very light
4,2020-04-28,Lucky if you can get a week out of this one and the scent isn't very strong.
4,2021-02-22,Smells amazing
1,2020-11-07,"What a disappointment. Pink Sands sounds exactly like a fragrance I would like.  I eagerly pulled off the lid to take a whiff and ""nothing"".  Perhaps I just can't smell it, so I tried again.....""nothing"".  OK, so maybe I have to burn it for awhile to really smell it, again......""nothing"".  Have never had this happen before.  I buy a lot of candles, usually, in a store where I can smell them in advance.  But, during covid, thought I would buy some online and the price of pink sands on amazon was a good deal.  Perhaps this candle is so old that it just doesn't smell any more or perhaps it never did have much of a scent when it had one.  But, for certain, there is no fragrance now."
4,2019-03-04,"Great product, but product arrived in a thousands pieces.  Did not even have to open the box the glass was coming through the box.  I do not understand because we ordered two candles and other came in fine...."
5,2014-08-15,Smells SO good!!!!!
1,2021-11-18,"I purchased this candle days ago and it has no scent at all!!! I just contacted customer service to get a refund and return the item but the associates didn't help. They will ""contact"" me in 24hrs by email regarding this issue. No questions about the item and truly no assistance at all. Yankee candles have a strong scent and this thing has none. Only the bottle with the name stating is a real Yankee candle which is definitely not!!!!! Scammer whoever sells this crap!!!"
3,2021-06-11,"I purchase this candle after seeing so many positive reviews but sadly I’m not a fan of the smell, it’s a little too sweet and fruity for me."
5,2015-03-01,Love it
2,2020-03-26,"I don't get it. Pink Sands smells nothing like the beach/ocean -- at least not the candle I received. This smells like....bananas. Ripe bananas. I tried to like this -- I kept trying to think it smelled like a Banana Daquiri, but nope. It just smells like bananas that have been sitting on the counter for a bit too long. Yuck."
4,2014-12-20,This is a nice candle.  You can tell its a higher quality than the cheaper ones that you get in stores. The fragrance is very nice and does smell like lilacs. I read several reviews that said the fragrance was subtle and another that said it was mild.  It's actually quite strong.
3,2022-06-17,"One arrived with the actual glass around the candle broken, the other was perfect and smells nice though. Got a refund for this one, so I guess I shouldn’t complain too much but it’s a bit concerning that it arrived with broken glass."
5,2013-04-14,FRESH CUT ROSES IS THE BEST SCENT EVER FOR CANDLES. I HAVE AND WOULD CONTINUE TO SUGEST BUYING YANKEE CANDLES WITH THIS AND OTHER SCENTS.
2,2022-05-19,"I ordered this candle because the scent is wonderful, but it came broken, they sent a replacement the next day and again the glass is broken. Yall need to do better when sending glass items."
4,2020-07-12,"Arrived broken and there isn’t a choice for me to return this. Now I’m stuck paying for an expensive, broken candle I cannot use. 👎🏽"
1,2020-04-23,This arrived with broken glass
4,2019-11-01,Nice smell.  A bit fruity for me but luckily it's not too overwhelming.  Lasts a long time.
5,2019-09-12,Keeps scent for long time! Best candle!
1,2021-08-29,"Honestly I’m not sure how this candle has the ratings it does. This thing smells so weak that I thought I may have lost my scent to covid. My apartment is a revolving door, and everyone said the same thing: “it doesn’t smell like anything.” Believe me, I asked! I cannot believe a near $20 candle can be this pathetic! Yankee candle? WTF! DO NOT BUY THIS CANDLE! The scent in itself somewhat smells nice like if you were to chop up the wax and snort it, because that’s the only way you’ll ever get a whiff of this PATHETIC candle! Seriously don’t be mislead! Look elsewhere."
3,2016-02-17,"I like this candle, but it came broken."
3,2022-05-16,The scent is fading. I guess that’s why it was on sale.
4,2022-05-25,
4,2018-03-23,"Nice smelling, in fact this candle will smell up  an entire room  which I love. But it's so big it becomes hard to light as it burns down.Just know that and I think you'll enjoy it."
2,2022-05-11,"Being a Yankee Candle, I expected the candle to have a great scent but I  really couldn't smell much of anything. It was a real disappointment."
1,2015-06-29,It smelled great when we lighted it for the first time. After the 2nd and 3rd time we lighted the candle it took at least 2 hours until the oil got warm enough and for the rose scent to fill the room. Save your money and look elsewhere.
4,2022-08-01,I bought this for my best friend and his wife. They liked it very much. Its scent smells so good.
3,2021-02-28,The scent is nice. It burns evenly. I’m unsure as to why the top of the jar turns black. It seems like it may make it smell burnt? I trim the wick before I burn it. It does last a while. I still prefer B&BW candles.
3,2020-09-13,It didn't have much of a fragrance when I opened the jar. You can't smell it when it's burning. I put it in a bathroom and closed the door and still not much scent at all. It's like the jar had the lid off it for a really long time and the fragrance is gone. I have purchased many items of this scent and this is the only one that is like this.
5,2018-12-10,Winter freshening of the house
3,2017-08-02,"Product smells nice but arrived with half the wax on one side of the jar. I had to melt it down and rotate in order to be able to even use the candle, as the wick was buried. That part was extremely disappointing as I have purchased many yankee candles in the past and never experienced this. After a few days I was able to utilize the candle."
5,2018-06-25,Smells nice
5,2018-12-10,Pleasant smell last along time
4,2020-10-26,Very nice scent!
4,2014-10-07,"Excellent product, a bit expensive however"
3,2014-08-20,"I didn't care much for this scent but decided to try it after reading the positive reviews.  The smell is very subtle until you walk out and come back into the room.  If you're looking for a subtle smell rather than an overwhelming one, then this is it.  Personally, I prefer the stronger, fruitier scents.  BUT the candle is still burning.  Yankee Candles are worth the price.  Also, check their website for more scents at the same price, only you have to pay for shipping."
4,2017-08-05,Burns slow and emits strong scent for large sized room. Follow directions for care on Yankee Candle jar. Amazon pricing for 22 oz is competitive from 3rd buyers but worth the occasional look. Big savings!
5,2017-01-25,Sad that this was discontinued
4,2014-02-06,"This is a nice floral scent. The 7 oz tumblers won't last long at all. I usually buy this size to try out a scent, and if I like it I'll get the bigger sizes which are better value. I find that none of the Yankee Candle scents are that strong so don't count on them as room freshners."
5,2016-02-19,Great as always
3,2020-06-22,"I had this in lilac and loved it. Then I got it in gardenia about 6 months later. The gardenia one doesn’t smell as strongly. The packaging is updated, I don’t know if they use less scent now or what."
5,2018-08-07,The BEST smelling candle out there - smells clean with a hint of a good smelling cologne.
2,2022-05-03,"Just a really mediocre candle. Not really unpleasant but not a quality scent, nor did it burn slowly as it should.  Not sure I would buy another one but it wasn't the worst I've purchased."
3,2020-12-04,"It burns nicely and lasts a long time butWhatever the scent is, it sure doesn’t smell like lavender.It’s a mediocre sent that burst. Not weak, just a bit chemical."
5,2019-02-20,product was what I expected
2,2021-03-24,"This candle smells like a cheap bar of soap. Like the kinda bar of soap you find at the dollar tree that nobody ever buys. It’s god awful, I tried to convince myself that maybe I was being extra but my 10 year old niece walked in and said “eww something smells like nasty flowers” and children don’t lie so I had to throw the candle away. I gave it two stars because the size is great but that’s about it."
3,2021-12-11,"This scent is there, but not strong.  Don’t think it’s a real yankee candle."
4,2020-04-08,"I love Yankee Candles and was happy to find one of my favorite scents especially for the price.  However, I was a little disappointed that the wax was misshapen and there is a small hole on the top of the candle, not the quality I usually get from either Yankee Candle or Amazon."
5,2013-09-14,the is the best scented candle by far. I wish the wouldn't of discontinued it so that it would be easier to access but as long as I can get it somewhere I am very happy
3,2022-01-11,This candle smells amazing but unfortunately arrived melted
5,2015-08-03,"love the smell, very floral, very nice, burns for a long time"
4,2013-09-07,"The Good:  We've been using these candles for years.  We love them and will continue to buy them.  They last for a very long time, give off pleasant but not overpowering fragrances, and come in a nice, stylist glass container.  We probably have 4 or 5 in the house right now in fact.The Bad:  On the downside, they are fairly expensive, especially when compared against other generic candles.  Additionally, when the candle starts to get low, the smoke tends to blacken the upper lip of the glass container, and is fairly unsightly.  Still, these negatives will not prevent me from"
2,2022-03-05,"The candle was old when I got it. No lilac smell. Wax was not very good. Maybe it was on the shelf too long, but wasn't giftable at all."
4,2020-09-01,Good Scent. Burbs well.
1,2020-04-11,"There is no way these are real Yankee candles. I got a Pink Sands Yankee candle for Christmas, and I loved it so much that I ordered 3 more on Amazon. The real one would literally permeate my entire home with the scent of a jolly rancher, and these have zero smell and burn down much too quickly. I thought I would save some money by purchasing on Amazon, but the joke was on me because I realized if you buy 3 large jars on the Yankee candle site, you get them for $18 each, which is pretty much what I paid for the 3 useless candles on Amazon. So disappointing."
5,2015-01-14,Best ever. Beautiful scent just like you were among a thousand roses. Worth every penny.
5,2019-01-23,Always pleased with whatever I order from  Amazon.  Thank you so much Fran Warner
5,2016-06-08,"My grandmother is a huge fan of rose scented candles. I have been having a lot of trouble finding rose scented candles in stores, including  stores such as Target, Walmart, and Kohls. The Yankee Candle Company is one of, if not the only, company that I can find and purchase rose scented candles. While I admit that this company is slightly expensive, they have great quality candles and the rose scent is one of my and my grandmothers favorites."
4,2020-06-18,"The scent is pleasant, but not very strong"
5,2019-10-18,good for smell
2,2020-11-05,Updated with replacement candle:Very disappointing.  Burned for the recommended time and does not burn evenly.The scent is wonderful but it came without a visible wick . Had to return it and request a replacement.
1,2022-04-25,I’ve bought this candid numerous times from different t places and it’s always been my favorite. This candle from Amazon has very little smell to it! U literally  have to stand right above it to smell anything. Highly disappointed. Would not buy from here again. Would not recommend. Although I would buy it from the yankee store because it comes with so much fragrance. Not sure what’s wrong with this one.
5,2012-11-06,"Great product! Burns nicely, smells great and lights up my room (y'know, b/c I don't have power thanks to Hurricane Sandy!)"
5,2019-03-30,Genuine candles 👍
2,2020-09-21,Am so sad! I was really looking forward to this and its sideways melted and no wick..... so I only got wax in a glass..... guess the ac wasn't working in the truck it was brought in. I dont know how else to explain this almost 2inches clean off the glass omg!
3,2021-02-15,I thought the scent would be more floral and subtle.... it’s a bit nauseating and smells like candy (according to my 10yo).  I don’t really enjoy this smell.
4,2017-08-02,Love it
5,2018-04-21,Fantastic!! ENJOYED THE FRAGRANCE!!
2,2022-01-22,For a Yankee Candle I was very disappointed in the scent.  I lit it and had to blow it out shortly after.  It did not smell like lilac and was very overpowering.  I tried leaving the lid off and that didn't work either.
4,2020-03-17,Smells amazing good for spring & summer!
4,2022-08-12,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 Just received the delivery. One of the candle is broken. Can be exchange for new one?"
4,2018-03-22,Enjoying the Car Booster my dog loves it!
3,2020-07-22,umm ya so this happened I ordered 2 of this sent of candles the first one was good but the second one looks like it was on its side and melted I cant even see the wick what am I supposed to with this?!
4,2019-01-26,I love the smell and the candle would last for all day or longer. It helps reduce the smell while cooking fried food.
5,2017-08-14,Love it !!!
4,2019-02-23,Much bigger then I expected. Which is no problem. Not quite the smell I was expecting but it's still really nice and fills the room
5,2020-02-24,Perfect aroma
1,2018-02-22,Arrived broken!! What a shame!
4,2020-03-01,Smells lovely. Just wish it would last longer
3,2020-09-03,Came completely shattered - I am for sure not able to gift this on Saturday. They will be sending me a replacement but I doubt it will be here in time. Very frustrated
5,2015-06-02,Sweet fragrance. Lasts a long time. Wipes out cigar smell.
5,2018-01-29,Satisfied
2,2022-03-06,I like to burn candles if they have a scent. Something must be wrong with my nostrils because I have brought 2candles from Amazon.com but I can’t smell them. Sorry.
5,2017-02-28,excellent fragrance.. My favorite so far among all the Yankee candles tested.
2,2022-05-11,"twice I received my order and the glass was broken/shattered and had to throw it away.  I want to order again, but I am afraid I will receive it and the glass will be broken.  I like yankee candles, I don't like the way my order is delivered."
3,2018-11-24,"for the first time with all the careful packaging, this candle arrived with the glass shattered and was a very dangerous situation to unpack. I buy these candles all the time and I have never had a broken one before. Very disappointed and will now have to order another candle for the Christmas holidays."
5,2017-02-03,Her favorite fragrance...always so very soothing and pleasant.
4,2020-07-12,great scent
4,2020-03-31,"nice scent, long lasting candle, perfect in the the kitchen"
5,2014-11-27,My favorite home fragrance for the Summer months.
2,2017-02-03,The smell is amazing but mine came in all shattered in pieces. If they could do better protection when shipping them so this doesn't happen that would be great.
4,2020-01-14,Always lived this scent. Reminds me of Spring.
4,2022-03-04,Attempts were made to make sure it wouldn’t break but some extra padding would’ve been nice. Thankfully still usable!
4,2019-06-18,Great scent
4,2021-07-15,A bit expensive ...
5,2014-04-29,"Green Grass is my favorite scent from Yankee Candle. This candle came wrapped in bubble wrap, sealed in a solid box, and I have enjoyed the scent throughout my home."
4,2015-12-29,"Great quality and very nice scent. Happy with the product, even though I find it a littleoutrageously insulting that scented wax can be so expensive. It is very well made andsturdy and should last a long while."
4,2019-06-28,It’s okay. Shop around & look for price value before you commit to this particular one
4,2022-01-05,👍
1,2017-08-18,"I am past the window to return but need to warn others this does not appear to be a real YANKEE Candle. The label looks like it but after the first three hours of it burning, there is not even a scent. The 'wax' appears to have some liquid in it, and the candle sits with all sorts of little bubbles on the top layer when not in use.  We have purchased YANKEE candles from the storefronts for years and we always like that they have a scent, unlike the inexpensive candles you can find other places.  This one does not burn like any YANKEE candle we have ever had and even the wick looks different, it is a lump of black, not the normal looking wick seen in all the other candles. Feel as though I have been duped. Disappointing!!"
2,2020-06-22,"I ordered once and liked the scent and longevity - so subscribed to it. Alas, this candle is not as fragrant as the last one. Is it possible that once you subscribe, Amazon starts sending Chinese counterfeit products or maybe this one is past expiration date... do candles have an expiration date??"
3,2021-03-29,"Pink Sands scent is super light. I don't know, it kind of smells sour to me. I'm waiting to see if it gets better."
4,2019-07-28,Smells like heaven without choking you on floral oil! Lasts what you would expect!
3,2020-09-25,"While the candle does smell like a lilac bush, the smell is somewhat overpowering. The candle itself continues to have a high flame and sputters."
4,2021-04-13,"Good, wish it lasted longer."
4,2019-07-10,Good
5,2015-12-26,Lovely fragrance and well packaged.
5,2016-07-03,Excellent
4,2019-12-13,The smell is ok but not something I would purchase again
4,2013-05-05,"I rely on user reviews when ordering an new product, so I thought I would throw my opinion into the mix.  When I opened the candle, there was a very strong sweet smell.  Burning, however, the strong scent is muted and very pleasant.  I agree with another reviewer:  this candle definitely reminds me of jolly rancher candy.  This is going to be a ""fun"" scent!In addition, Amazon's packaging of this item was excellent -- there was no way this candle was going to get broken in transit!"
2,2021-06-13,I love the smell of roses but this candle was disappointing.  Not only did it not provide a beautiful rose aroma but the wick ended up not burning as long as it should have.
5,2015-06-05,This candle is strong but it smells dightful.
3,2022-06-26,GIFT
5,2019-03-17,I bought this over and over again because it's simply the best
5,2019-02-12,"I simply love the smell, so calming, use in my home!"
3,2015-02-08,Love my Yankee candle.
4,2016-03-30,Bought this for my girlfriend and she love it! Fast delivery also!
3,2019-07-17,"I love Yankee candles but this scent is a little too sweet for my taste—similar to the smell off cotton candy. I still burn it regularly as it smells better than my dog, but I’d take the clean linen Yankee candle over this scent any day!"
4,2015-08-05,"Then go for the ""Fresh Cut Roses"". We've had them all and that one smells best. This is nice and if it's color you're after it'll do fine. But fresh cut roses (pink) smells better and stronger"
2,2019-05-16,I used to be a HUGE yankee candle fan! Maybe this one wasnt made up of the same chemicals/wax ingredients but even my boyfriend asked me send this back. We were looking for something to replace our constant flow of Bath and Body Works candles but we wont buy this again. Barely any scent - if at all - and still just as pricey as BB&W. Not worth it honestly.
5,2019-03-08,It’s great! Got it for my girlfriend and she was sooo happy.
2,2021-09-04,"We love the Yankee candles and their strong scent. The company no longer offers our favorite scent Beach Walk, so I thought I would try Amazon. The candle looks like the ones from Yankee Candle. But, when it is lit even for long periods there is really no scent. I am disappointed and will not buy it again"
2,2018-09-20,"I bought two Yankee candles, Lilac Blossoms and Midnight Jasmine.  Both smell lovely but glass jar on the Jasmine arrived broken so I am only giving this one two stars. I was able to glue the pieces back on so at least it wasn't wasted. The Lilacs smell just like the flower but the Jasmine smells more like patchouli to me, still a lovely smell."
2,2021-01-08,Not a fan of the lilac scent nor the 2 wick tumbler candle. The scent was nothing like a lilac nor other Yankee Candle’s I have bought. The 2 wick tumbler seemed to burn very fast. I’ll stick with the jars.
2,2020-06-23,The item they sent me was already used. Wick was already burned andwax showed signs of having already been melted. Scent is very strong. Was going to be a gift but not going to give anybody something that's obviously already been used!
4,2021-08-21,I can’t really smell the candle once it was burning and it burns out really quick.
5,2019-02-03,Amazing!
3,2020-09-21,"I loveee these candles, the scent is very nice but when lit it does not smell like my other candles do. It does last a long time however."
4,2015-09-07,"This candle is very nice for summertime, the scent is not too strong or cloying and yet a nice throw of scent.  I'll be moving through the house, and catch the scent, like a cool breeze.  Does remind me of the beach."
4,2013-06-23,"This is my first Yankee Candle so I wasn't sure what to expect. The fragrance is rather sweet compared to the 3 doz roses I have in my yard. The candle is long lasting, so that's a plus. I will probably try another scent if I order another sometime."
2,2021-08-26,I had to send it back to strong
4,2022-05-22,The Size but I wish it was more Fragrant I like Yankee Candles Stores Privately OwnedBut I would Buy it again
5,2015-02-27,Birthday gift and they really like it
3,2022-08-11,"I didn’t care for this candle, it gives very little smells"
3,2021-03-07,"I was under the impression that Yankee Candle was the best.  I have to say the aroma is better when the candle is unlit.  It smells ""bitter""when burning.  I absolutely love the smell of lilacs, but this candle was a disappointment."
2,2022-05-24,It does NOT smell like lilacs. The smell is overpowering. Wasted my money.
2,2022-02-25,I was surprised how little to no scent for a Yankee candle.  They have such a good reputation for being a great scented candle.  Very disappointed
3,2020-02-13,I absolutely love “pink sands” scent and how well yankee works. The only reason why I didn’t put 5 stars is because even if I order “pink sands” they always send me a different scent.
2,2020-04-14,This was disappointing. I bought the same candle and a different retailer and fell in love with the smell. This one I ordered didn't provide any smell. Very disappointing.
3,2022-04-25,Smoked too much.
3,2022-05-18,Compared to previous yankee candles I have had.
5,2016-04-12,Great purchase!
5,2014-07-08,This has to be the greatest candle ever created. The smell is incredible and smells like real roses. Even my boyfriend likes it!
5,2018-11-12,Perfect scent
3,2020-07-22,"I love these candles unfortunately I was shipped two broken candles. The first was broken and amazon sent me another at no cost so I was stoked! Okay I’m gonna get another candle that isn’t broken at no cost. Okay what could go wrong? Well it came in today and it’s broken even more so than the first one. I’m just gonna go to a store and buy these from now on. This is ridiculous. Great candles I love them, just bad shipping and handling."
5,2016-03-31,I like it. It filled the room with the fragrance in an hour.
4,2016-06-09,"I love Yankee Candles. They do their job,  which is releasing a wonderful aroma through your home. No headache, I have burn candles that would bring on a migraine. Mine came wrapped so that the glass around the candle couldn't break. Pick up your favorite scent today. Update: August 9th, 2016 I purchased this the third candle and this one isn't lilac blossom. They must have put the wrong label on this lilac colored candle. It has a sweet smell but it isn't what I wanted. Oh well I already started burning it. I still love Yankee candles. I'm just not crazy about the scent I received."
3,2014-11-08,"It would be preferred if Amazon would be more forthcoming about ""Used"" items being broken. The candle was wrapped so well it took me easily 30 minutes to undo the bubble wrap.  Yes, there was a piece (rather large) missing which meant the cover would not stay on.  Shipping further damaged it as two more pieces of the jar came off with the wrapping. It is not burnable as the breakage exposes at least two inches of the wax.  I will keep it for the fragrance alone. A valuable lesson for me to learn that ""Used"" - even though re-wrapped - is a risk!"
4,2021-12-29,I got my order today and one of the candles had gotten hot at somettime and was melted. It cannot be used. I would like it to be replaced.
3,2021-07-07,"Usually yankee candles are good for fragrance.  Not so much, this one."
1,2021-07-11,I usually love Yankee Candle but this one almost $30 it smells like nothing which is very unusual because they're known for a very nice smelling candle but I had already lit it and let it burn so couldn't return highly dissatisfied more sad than anyting cuz I love this scent not this particular Jar..but had been a Fan for years..that's what I get 4 not smelling it 1st. Like I usually do at Y.C. store in my Mall ):
4,2012-08-24,I love the smell of gardenias but this candle is extremely strong.  It is a little too strong for my 2 bedroom apartment to handle.  If you have a large space then this is the candle for you.  It also burns a little fast.
3,2015-07-08,"I'm a lavender purist so this is just ""ok"".  Smells lavender-y -- not like pure lavender essential oil.  Flowery as opposed to herby.  Sweet.  Not my preference but it'll do."
4,2019-07-27,Not the best smelling...not the worse either.  Great gift!
5,2017-11-06,"love this scent, hope they bring it back!"
2,2021-03-05,Not sure what's up with this candle but the scent of it is extremely weak. I'm not sure of how long it'll burn because it was pointless for me to light it a second time.
2,2021-05-02,for a yankee candle this scent is too weak
5,2016-12-03,I love it!
1,2014-09-02,"Potentially due to just the heat of the truck.  The candle was delivered on time but completely melted and unusable, I tried to dig the wick out but it didn't work.  $20 paperweight."
3,2021-03-31,This candle does not give a scent. It's just a light source. Very disappointed
5,2018-07-27,Smells pretty good.
2,2020-12-20,This does not smell at all like the candle purchased direct at the yankee candle storeThis literally had no sent and I have bought this exact scent before. So it’s for sure a knock off or a defect
4,2020-03-29,<eom>
3,2022-05-10,My product came broken.  It was shattered into pieces.  I love this product but would rather receive it still in tact.
5,2015-06-10,love it
3,2021-07-24,Very disappointed.  I put it in my kitchen for one  whole day . Absolutely no scent .
3,2021-06-15,Scent is very light. I figured for the price it would be stronger. It’s ok for smaller rooms like a bedroom.
5,2015-08-19,Great
3,2020-05-03,This candle burns great.  It’s just not a smell I liked very much.  I burned it a few times and ended up giving it to a friend who liked the smell.
5,2015-02-14,"Smells just like a dozen roses, period. No chemical smell, no sweet smell added. I love this candle."
4,2020-01-16,Good strong scent but a little too sweet for my taste. Reminds me of candy
3,2021-04-10,The scent is not as strong as I had expected from a Yankee Candle product.
5,2016-09-24,I love this candle and it's wonderful relaxing scent
4,2020-02-17,Candle has a very pleasant scent and last a long time
3,2016-12-30,"Good product, but could have paid less in the store, paid full price, my bad did not shop around"
5,2019-05-08,Nice soft scent.
3,2018-04-13,"I love this candle company, and I love this scent.  This particular candle looks like it got hot once, perhaps where it was stored.  The oil and wax have separated oddly, and the oil was leaked all over the box.  I'll order it again, but this one was a little disappointing."
4,2016-11-11,"Good candle, but scent is barely noticeable when smelled directly, however scent DOES permeate the room while it is burning. Subtle beach scent, not overbearing."
5,2018-08-13,Smells great!
3,2022-07-19,"I bought 4 candles, 3 of them seem to be fine but one of them was not full. I’ve never seen a candle with a big gap like the pink candle has. Not easy to see from picture but the gap goes down to the bottom."
3,2021-10-03,This candle has a very strong scent. You can only use it for a little bit at a time. It’s also more expensive than other similar brands.
4,2021-07-04,Awesome fragrance! Unfortunately the wick was way off center.
4,2017-11-18,VERRRY STRONG BE AWARE. Also there was oil all over the glass when I opened it?
4,2020-11-07,This candle smells heavenly. The jar is too big.
4,2020-01-17,Best smell ever but unfortunately the smell doesn’t last and Yankee candles are pretty pricey!
3,2020-05-17,"Didn’t care for the scent of this one.. the notes in the description do not describe it at all! Throw was a medium, on the weaker side."
2,2021-11-15,"Its been burning for 3 hrs in a small room, not a difference. Other scents from Yankee and other brands would have filled the room with fragrance by now, but this one is meh!! Guess there is a reason this one is on sale."
2,2021-05-21,I feel like this isn’t originally a yankee candle. I lit this up in my bathroom for 1 hour & couldn’t even smell the thing when i walked in my bathroom. I’ve bought it before at bed bath & beyond & it scented multiple rooms but this one didnt even scent my bathroom. I wouldn’t recommend buying it. Considering the price you would pay for a large yankee candle is much more than this one it’s a bit odd & understandable why is much cheaper.
2,2021-04-11,"This scent is not their best.  Bought it because of great reviews. But, if you don’t don’t like any flowery or sweet smells, this one may be for you."
3,2022-04-15,"Really smells more like lavender, which I don’t like, than lilacs, which I do like. But it was packaged well, and arrived on time. Just lit it a little while ago. I’m hoping it smells more like lilacs as I burn it."
1,2021-07-29,"This used to be my favorite fragrance.  I don't know why, but the company changed the aroma formulation from what it was to a very stinky odor.  Honestly, it smelled like jet fuel at the airport.  Perhaps I was sent a bad batch, but whoa, bad smell came from that jar."
3,2021-07-06,It’s was ok you can’t even smell the sense of lavender on Burning it 😒
2,2021-12-11,So its a great candle for light but even in a small room there is next to no smell
5,2016-02-29,Long lasting smell!
5,2017-05-20,Love the scent
4,2017-09-16,Love it
4,2020-03-14,Love this candle !!
4,2019-11-05,Love the scent
1,2014-01-27,I chose this rating because I was disappointed with the aroma emitted.  You could barely smell the lavender and for$29.99 it was so overpriced
3,2021-04-02,Disappointing...scent isn't as strong as they used to be.
1,2021-08-18,"I have ordered candles from Amazon before. The last few times I’ve had nothing but problems.  As you can see it’s defective to the point I cannot light it.  I’ve had cracked jars, melted candles , no wick.  I’m really disappointed.  And I’m walking on crutches so it’s not easy to return things over and over to Koles or UPS."
2,2022-03-13,Did not have much scent.  Did not last very long AT ALL
3,2021-03-02,When I received this candle it was completely melted to the side (in winter). So that was disappointing the scent is still great. I was able to fix it myself and it’s working great. Wouldn’t recommend for a gift but otherwise great.
5,2016-02-19,LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  Enjoy using this candle!!
2,2022-02-06,This doesn’t smell like sun and sand. Has a cleaner smell
4,2019-12-17,Pricey
3,2017-03-23,"Candle is great, but the price I paid  (~$16) is a little steep for a 7 oz candle. If you're not sure how big a 7 oz candle is, it's probably smaller than you expect. The popular home goods store sells these for $11.99. So, yeah."
1,2020-09-07,"I received the two candles yesterday.  The Village Candle was perfect, packaged well in a larger box with plastic bubbles.  The Yankee Candle was sent in a small box just large enough to hold it tightly,  The candle was melted, and had poured into the cap, leaked out into the box.....what a mess, and a waste of $25.  I will try to melt it and retrieve the wick, because I don't have a printer for the postage return, and I'm not going out to mail it during this COVID thing.  Very unhappy with this product/purchase."
4,2020-02-19,I love the lilac candle.  The fragrance is heat and fills the house.
4,2017-06-18,It's a pretty color and does have a lovely lilac scent.  Just a bit pricey for what it is.
1,2018-05-22,No scent.
4,2013-07-13,"This candle is stronger than I expected (given that some reviews mentioned that it wasn't very strong). It smells quite strong when it's not being lit and a little mellower when it is lit, but I can't keep it on for very long because of the strong smell.It does smell quite nice though."
4,2017-06-19,Gardenia is a favorite scent in my home. This candle can do no wrong. :)~ Kort
4,2019-03-29,"I like it, the small is not strong enough though but it's smooth."
4,2019-04-19,Great candle quality and great scent.
2,2021-03-02,"It just doesn't have enough scent for my taste. It smells nice though, would probably be good for those who prefer a more subtle scent."
3,2020-11-14,1 of the candles were broken - top cracked  I can forward a picture if you’d like
5,2013-09-18,What more can I say? Yankee Candles seem to give the most aroma. It really smells like a rose.Pharmair
2,2021-05-05,"I have purchased this item before, no concerns good product however this time the scent is weak. I burned the candle for three hours I couldn't smell the candle until I was six feet away :("
4,2019-02-05,"Very nice Smell, good durability, only wish the smell  was stronger"
1,2022-03-27,I do not think this is an Authentic Yankee candle.  Pink Sands is my favorite.  I know how it smells.  It is the only scent I buy.  I usually get them from Walmart but it was out of stock.  As you can see from the picture it looks like a white candle with pink wax poured around it.  It has no scent.  I am so disappointed.  I wish I could give -10.☹
1,2021-12-17,"This candle does not look like the photo… it’s a very dark purple. Also the smell is off, not that lovely lavender/vanilla scent. I can’t even describe the smell. I would not recommend this."
4,2019-05-03,Great smelling & burning candle
4,2020-02-10,Long burn time. Scent is strong.
4,2018-04-02,The fragrance was true to the flower.
4,2017-01-03,I love Yankee Candles. I burn them twice a day for about 2 hours each session. I find the floral scents very relaxing.
5,2016-07-24,"This jar smells like lavender and it will last quite a long time. It is exactly what i was looking for. The scent isn't too strong or over powering, just right."
4,2013-10-08,"great product --- I love yankee candles, but I def think I will buy direct next time --- The shipping was way too much and I feel that this candle would've been cheaper in store"
2,2020-08-07,"The lid and the top of the glass container the candle is in came dangerously broken.  Be careful opening.  It's a Yankee candle, so it's what I expected in every other way."
2,2021-09-26,"Longevity failure.  The wick burned out when there was over 1.15"" left in the candle"
3,2020-05-14,"My mom loves this scent, but it’s a bit strong to the rest of us. It covers cooking smells well though!"
3,2021-03-08,Not as fragrant as they used to be.
4,2019-06-25,👌🏼
4,2019-07-09,I have pets and this product gives me the help I need for my home smelling fresh
2,2020-11-04,This candle was a very big disappointment I normally buy seaside woods which makes my house smell delicious this candles did not emit any aroma
5,2017-01-11,Very prompt service exactly what it was supposed to be too excellent price
4,2013-03-28,"Great non-overpowering scents in a very long lasting, nice looking jar.  We always keep several of these on-hand.  Also I highly recommend Yankee's Jasmine scented candle."
5,2015-08-12,as expected
1,2017-05-23,"I would have loved the product had I actually received it.  Instead, I received a vanilla cupcake scented candle.  Now I have to return it, and either pay UPS to pick it up, or drive 5 miles out of my way to drop it off at a UPS Store!!!  NOT acceptable."
5,2014-06-06,I've been looking for this scent for months.  I love spraying the scent or lighting the candle just to make me feel good.
1,2022-07-12,Not real Yankee candles. Yankee candle no more. Bought 6 in different fragrance in November 2021 and just decide to use it. No scent. It melted in less than an hour. Stop using Yankee name. Fake
1,2022-04-23,"I bought many Yankee Candles in the past, and loved them. Lately (1-2 years) they have had NO smell at all. What happened???  I was very disappointed, and will not recommend them at all. What a shame! A good name, a bad product...."
3,2015-06-02,"I bought the candle for myself.  If I had bought it for a gift it was not presentable to give.  It must have melted somewhat in transit, and there was an empty space on one side, and a bump on the top which I had to pare away with a knife in order to find the wick.  I can still use and enjoy it, but like I mentioned.....if I had purchased it as a gift it would not be presentable enough to give."
2,2020-12-13,"Enchanted Moon: this candle doesn’t seem to have much of a scent, certainly not the expectation from this brand.Usually these candles are fantastic."
4,2020-03-11,Home
4,2019-08-01,Yankee makes good candlesDon’t know what happened with the four I bought but the scent was not really there when we lit them
2,2020-06-14,I'm having a tough time picking up the smell of this candle even when I place my nose above it. Also the wick is not straight causing it to burn violently with soot.
2,2021-07-18,No more lavendae candles for me. Especially not ones purchased from. Amazon.
4,2018-07-15,"These products are so expensive, but I suppose they’re alright."
5,2015-02-06,This candle is amazing. I purchased over a dozen Yankee candles this holiday season and this one was by far the best one
4,2017-03-12,i love this candle i burn it all the time i just love the smell of gardenia very soothing and relaxing.
4,2019-02-26,Sweet smell and long lasting!
3,2016-09-05,"The candle itself is just fine. However, my product arrived covered in a strange oil... I had to wash the candle 5x with soap and water to get it off, and the label peeled off from all the oil. Some other oil-based perfumed product must have broken on or near the box. The box the candle was in was also covered in oil. Not a great experience for a premium product ($25 candle) - will not purchase online again."
4,2018-04-19,Smells great but range is limited
4,2019-05-07,Nice strong scent.
4,2018-05-24,"Great scent, I always purchase Yankee candles."
5,2018-10-31,Light
3,2020-08-13,Smell not as I thought it would be. Don’t really use it now.
3,2021-03-09,Not as strong of a scent as I hoped
4,2021-06-26,"Scent is fine, but not a lot of throw."
1,2021-03-16,"I bought it as part of my wife's Christmas this past year but when she opened the candle it seemed to be made incorrectly or had gotten hot and melted. I took the photos attached on 12/30 and put the candle in a cabinet and forgot about it until I went to clean the cabinet on Sunday,3/14. I didn't realize I checked the order today and found that I had 30 days to get a refund or replacement. Amazon customer service told me I could send it back but I would be charged a restocking fee, couldn't tell me how much the fee would be so after 34 minutes on the phone I called it quits. Good luck restocking that one if I would have sent it in. I'm a bit disappointed with Amazon as I've been a good customer for a number of years and figured they would do more. Ultimately my fault for forgetting about it. Twenty-three bucks down the tubes. Maybe I can put it in hot water and it will reform properly."
1,2021-09-22,"I bought the gardenia and the jasmine, two powerful scents in nature although, sadly, not in these candles. I made scented candles myself back in the 70s. When we cleaned out my parents house in 2008 the candles I had given them maintained an intense fragrance so really there is no excuse for this insipid offering."
1,2017-06-20,I cannot believe that this candle was for purchase. No smell whatever. Every person who came into the house couldn't smell it either. Very disappointed . It was bought for me by my grandson who saved his money to buy this.
3,2019-12-19,"Doesn't seem authentic. Yankee candles usually smell amazing & last a very long time, this one hardly compared."
4,2021-04-15,"No scent whatsoever, do not waste your money! It seems I spent $20.00 on a purple candle"
2,2021-09-14,Might have been an old candle but I expected strong odor candle. That's why I ordered a Yankee candle. Disapointed
4,2018-11-20,Can't beat 14 dollar Yankee Candle.
3,2020-09-22,"Like other scent better, like lavender scentmuvh better."
4,2018-05-03,Love the smell!! Wasn't as strong as I had hoped it would be
1,2020-11-05,"I love candles, especially jasmine scented ones, so I was really excited to receive this one and I had heard good things about Yankee Candles. However, I'm not sure what happened as it arrived looking like this. My best guess is it melted in transit and hardened all messed up. I'm currently melting it down on the stove in hopes of fixing it. I had also bought a different candle from Chesapeake Bay Candles that arrived perfectly fine. I will have to try out Chesapeake's jasmine candles in the future."
5,2017-06-20,Smells great
4,2021-02-25,Lovely smell.
4,2013-06-16,"Although a little expensive, Yankee Candles are worth every penny. I bought these candles back in March and they're still going strong-that's with me burning them practically every day for at least four hours at a time. The smell is wonderful and with only two candles burning downstairs my entire house, both upstairs and downstairs (My house is over 2,000 sq.ft) smell like pink sands!"
4,2021-03-20,"Candle smells ok, floweryScent penetration is bad, good luck having it be smelled farther than 10 feet out"
3,2020-12-20,Got this candle for a gift arrived on time the fragrance itself could have been a little stronger but maybe when lit it will have a nice throw but anyway I am not a candle fan but it is a good deal if looking for a gift for yourself or a friend
4,2021-03-25,Only thing I can complain about is the glass jar was chipped around the top edge. Other than that exactly what I expected!!!
1,2020-05-19,I was disappointed with this candle. I went to Yankee Candle because they have a great fragrance. This isn’t true with this one. After blowing out the candle black smoke billows off the wick for a while. I bought a candle that has no smell. Should have bought a glade candle. So disappointed
4,2016-04-21,"I love the smell, it's a little too faint for my preference but definitely still nice. Pink sands is still my favorite,"
5,2017-02-21,Good price
5,2018-04-27,Love this scent
1,2020-04-25,This scent is horrible wait a minute what scent? I purchased another scent by Yankee last week that really had my room smelling nice so I took a chance with the honey lavender thinking I would be satisfied well I was wrong. You can’t smell it when it’s lit. It’s been burning for 30 minutes now. I will never purchase again. I’m very disappointed.
2,2021-08-19,"Yankee is definitely not what they used to be. Their scents are weaker,  the scent throw is horrible and the wax looks like crayon wax. I used to love yankee candles, but after the last few, I'm just going to have to find a different supplier."
4,2018-10-27,BUT SURE SMELLS GOOD
3,2020-07-10,"Love the smell, it's my favorite - that's why I ordered 2. Unfortunately, one of them was shattered & broken throughout the glass. Amazon issued a refund though - as a gift card. Which is odd because I paid with my credit card..."
5,2015-03-29,My favorite!
1,2014-01-22,"This is the second candle I tried, I hate it, it stinks.. In a bad way. I wanted a candle that smells like fresh cut grass and this candle doesn't even come close .. I would not recommend this item"
3,2018-03-05,Beach walk is too heavy of a smell. It's OK and I can  burn it for an hour but the smell will last a day. It does not smell like a Beach Walk either.
4,2021-05-10,"Candle smelled great, but did not burn evenly"
4,2020-12-26,Yes lovely scent
3,2020-10-27,Wasn't impressed by scent
3,2022-07-27,It doesn’t smell as good as other Yankee candles I had
4,2018-03-25,Beautiful smelling gorgeous flowery scent
2,2021-10-28,The candle was gone so quickly. 😳Expensive
2,2020-04-01,Went with this as it was last yankee candle in stock. I understand why now. Overall it smells nice unfortunately doesn’t carry at all never even knew it was lit based on scent in the house.
3,2019-08-03,This candle has very little aroma. In fact the lavender is almost undetectable. Very disappointing for a Yankee candle.
4,2021-09-21,I was sent to wrong fragrance….Luckily I liked it and kept it!
2,2019-01-31,"Very disappointed as this is one of my favorite scents. However, first candle burned for 2 hours and would not burn the next day. Amazon (go Amazon) quickly sent a replacement but this one only burnt three quarters before wick won't burn anymore."
2,2020-06-02,"It says the scent is Gardenia but, to me, it smells like Raid Roach spray... so it will become a candle used in case of a hurricane. Sadly."
5,2015-02-23,Love the scent.
1,2021-04-26,I love the pink sands scent and have purchased plug ins but this has no scent.  I have to get right up to it to even get a hint of the scent.  I wanted my whole house to smell of it.  Feeling like I've been scammed.
3,2022-05-29,Love the product
5,2014-08-08,"I love the candle, but it had an oil that spilled all over the bubble wrap and got every where. I cleaned it, which isn't a problem. Just run it under hot water and let it air dry, no big deal. Just a heads up that this can happen.Other then the leakage, I love the smell and candle. Yankee Candles certainly are the best candles around in my opinion."
4,2019-10-31,I love yankee candles
3,2020-07-22,My candles came melted unfortunately.
3,2019-10-18,"I ordered 2 of these candles, one was perfect, the other candle jar was shattered, having to return it."
5,2015-02-20,These will make great gifts for my mother's birthday. She loves the scent of roses. Thank you!
3,2020-12-15,Not my favorite. Really strong and not a great scent
2,2014-08-20,Not their strongest smelling candle. Will not buy again.
2,2020-03-31,"Even after hours of burning, I can't even notice the scent of this candle when it's sitting only two feet away from me. I love the scent, I just wish I could smell it! When using a Bath and Body Works 3-wick candle in the same manner, the scent is easily noticeable. I'll be sticking to Bath and Body Works 3-wick candles."
3,2020-06-08,Good thing this could be regifted. It was.
4,2016-01-20,A+
5,2017-08-21,Absolutely love the smell!
3,2016-06-20,"The candle arrived with the jar smashed in tiny pieces, I had to find a new holder so I could burn it.  That was very difficult many stores did not have a jar that would fit the candle.  The product that works very well."
4,2018-02-27,Smells good though a little weak
4,2019-04-18,"Not a very strong scent, I only noticed it when I was close to it.  I did enjoy it, just wish the aroma was more present."
2,2019-10-21,"Super disappointed by this yankee candle. I guess that's why it was on sale? It doesnt smell AT ALL.Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating. It smells if you put your nose within a few inches of it. -___-"
4,2013-04-08,"For best results, place this candle on a sunny window sill (unlit) and enjoy. Yankee makes the strongest scented candles you don't necessarily need to light them!"
4,2018-03-05,Okay but not very fragrant.
4,2020-12-19,Good candles
2,2015-08-03,"Pretty disappointed in the throw of this candle.  The scent is absolutely amazing, but I have to walk right up to it to smell it at all.  Perhaps old stock?  I guess that's the risk you take buying from Amazon and not direct from Yankee Candle."
3,2020-09-29,Very little fragrance.
2,2021-05-19,Love Lilacs but this candle is almost sickening..
4,2018-03-20,One of my favs. Clean smell.
2,2020-09-19,"Like the title mentioned, I can barely smell it. I have to come close in order to get a faint odor."
3,2021-06-15,The outside of the glass was very greasy when it arrived. And the candle discolored.  Like it had been sitting on its side for a long time. Once wiped off it smells fine. But it didn’t arrive in good condition
2,2014-01-03,"I didn't know the difference between soy candles and wax candles when I bought this. It burned nicely, but , it burns down through the candle and a lot of wax is left on the side. A soy candle burns the whole candle. From now on, I will look for soy candles."
2,2021-12-17,could not use
3,2013-12-29,"I was skeptical about buying this based on the reviews that said that this doesn't have a strong fragrant smell. However, since I love the smell of gardenia's, I bought it anyway.  I agree with the reviewers-there is a FAINT whiff of gardenia, but you really have to make a conscious effort to smell it.  Not worth the $$ and will not buy again."
5,2014-10-20,"I’m trying to catch up on YEAR’S worth of Amazon purchases / reviews….  I honestly don’t remember buying this -- but, since I love Yankee candles and I don’t recall ever having a problem with the purchase/reception of this item, I’ll give it 5 stars.  (I truly believe one cannot ever go wrong with a Yankee candle!)"
2,2020-11-19,The wick is buried in the wax! I have to destroy the candle to find it. Should be perfect for the price of it. Returning is not worth the time and energy. Very Disappointed!
4,2021-09-13,Scent of ocean candles never comes off quite right
1,2022-05-10,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 Broken glass"
4,2019-12-18,Like the scent
5,2016-03-23,Awesome
3,2021-01-07,Compared to other candles this one is very expensive. It does the job but not worth the price.
3,2014-07-07,Not as strong smelling as I would have liked
2,2020-08-21,Barely any scent and this candle was gone in a few weeks of use. Sounds like they have retooled the formula and lost their strong lovely scents. On to a new brand.
4,2014-02-01,"Beautiful candle, lovely scent, would buy this again maybe in a different scent, to try it. Such a pretty color, too."
3,2022-06-11,Scent not strong enough
2,2021-06-21,There is no fragrance mail from this candle.
1,2021-06-03,The candle smells great you would expect it to send a strong aroma all throughout the house? but it is surprisingly weak! I could hardly smell it at all! I have had Dollar Store candles smell stronger👎
2,2020-10-05,"The scent is nice, though you literally have to hold the jar up to your nose to smell any fragrance. To no avail, I lit the candles numerous time for several hours. Faint, faint smell...so very disappointing."
2,2020-07-01,I love Gardenia scent but this was very weak and did not last! Not like the quality Yankee Candle is known for.
4,2020-07-31,Smelled very good. Very appropriate gift to give family friend or co worker. Unfortunately it was broken when I received it. Great price tho
4,2019-02-01,"I purchased this as a gift. Although I didn't smell the scent, I enjoy Yankee Candles. They typically are true to the fragrance advertised."
3,2017-05-15,"The scent is absolutely lovely. However, the throw is so little that I could be 5 feet away from this candle and have no idea that is is up and burning. (And I live in a small apartment, so there are rarely competing smells!)"
3,2021-07-15,Candle looked old like maybe had been stored improperly and possibly melted at some point. Little to no smell compared to yankee candles I have purchased in stores.
2,2020-11-12,Scent barely noticeable. For the price I paid I expected a much stronger lilac smell. Highly disappointed
1,2021-06-05,"yankee has always been hit or miss with me--this one burns very dirty--I keep the wicks trimmed, and still black soot all over the glass as it burns. Cannot smell it at all."
4,2018-07-06,nice
3,2020-06-23,I did not smell the beach . Nice candle though.
4,2014-12-18,"Smells amazing, but when I received the candel it was covered in wax im thinking from another candel."
4,2017-09-28,"Love the smell, but I do wish it was stronger."
4,2017-11-08,Last forever but the scent is just okay.
2,2020-07-13,No idea on longevity but the scent isn’t nice at all and it arrived to me in a melted puddle of wax.
4,2018-02-13,Very nice scent.
2,2019-02-06,"I am not loving how this “Yankee” candle is burning. When I buy them from YankeeCandle.com this NEVER happens, they burn all around and nice like they should. If these are not real Yankee Candle that’s total BS!"
4,2017-11-05,lovely.  but... expensive.
3,2017-08-30,"The candle has a nice smell, very crisp, clean and fresh. However, it does emit an unseen black soot. It was too close to my wall one day and left the soot there. Other than that, it's all right."
2,2021-08-09,"Smell was fine, but the black smoke...NO...yes I did cut the wick"
3,2020-04-08,"When I removed the lid of the candle,  I could barely smell the scent, and I love the Pink Sands scent.  After burning the candle for over 4 hours, there still was hardly any throw.  I think maybe the candle was old??? I don't know. Surely disappointing, but it's fine."
5,2014-11-27,I am very well pleased with my purchase.  I am sure my daughter will love.
4,2018-03-08,good scent
4,2020-06-20,I feel like this is a good candle
3,2020-03-16,Not loving the sent to much. But it will do.
3,2021-03-14,Very mild scent for a Yankee Candle.  Expected better.
2,2021-03-16,Very little scent on these Amazon Yankee candles .
1,2021-12-21,This glass jar candle smells great! Unfortunately the glass jar arrived broken making it unusable. It is shipped to you at your risk. So good luck! It will be a great smelling and pleasant candle if it arrives in good condition.
2,2021-04-20,"I was so sad when this candle arrived. I absolutely love Golden Sands and now that it is being discontinued, it is hard to find. I will not purchase candles again if they are just tossed in with styrofoam peanuts."
3,2018-02-11,Not a Strong Scent. Burns uneven. Wick breaks off while burning and falls into the wax. Only giving a 3 Star because I got it on a Clearance Sale Price.
3,2019-07-28,Not strong at all. Nice scent. Use in a small room if you want to smell it.
3,2021-12-31,"There was no hint of ""A tropical beach breeze of sweet orange flower, lemony citrus, fresh lavender, and powdery musk"". Very disappointing."
1,2020-07-11,No Smell. Yankee’s quality control has been atrocious in the past few years. 75% of the way through this candle and I have yet to smell it. Pink Sands and Lilac Blossom are the only 2 I’ve bought that haven’t had at least 1 have no smell at all. Buy Woodwick instead. More expensive but at least you get a scent.
2,2020-11-16,The scent is too flowery....not enough beachy as expected. Bought on sale so it's ok.
4,2016-02-14,Soft scent. Would prefer a little more oomph. Satisfied with the price.
1,2021-12-28,"Where's the scent?  We ordered the Gardenia but you can't smell it. Yankee candles use to be premium candles, but no more. Proof positive that price isn't always an indicator of good quality.  Very disappointing."
3,2021-08-29,Doesn't give off much scent when lit.
4,2016-08-08,This candle smells good and true to the scent of Roses.
1,2021-04-20,I ordered this candle because it’s advertised as rose scented.  Instead it smells like home made caramel that somehow went badly.  Kind of a combination of feet and caramel.  I fully expected this to smell like my grandmother’s bathroom - I mean before grandpop got in there.
1,2018-06-02,When I buy Yankee candles from Amazon they either don't have a scent or the wick is to short and goes out quickly as melted wax fills the jar.  I then have to dig out the melted wax for it to work again. Wastes a whole lot of the candle. Only will buy directly from Yankee now as they give you credit for bad candles. I am the Amazon Queen lol all else I get it wonderful
2,2021-08-04,Yankee candle quality isn’t what it used to be. There is almost no throw and when I smell the fragrance it’s very faint.
2,2018-12-14,Very disappointed about the condition of the candle when it arrived...I don’t want to believe it left yankee candle in this condition. It had all melted to one side and the wick was buried beneath wax. Had to dig it out to get it lit. As you can see had to shave a lot of was off to get it lit. Yankee candle should look into how their product is being shipped.
4,2017-12-18,Smells great
3,2020-02-24,buying this rose scent is a waste....
3,2022-04-03,Love the scent but very weak when burning  and doesnt last
3,2020-05-27,Smell goed aways after few use
3,2018-04-17,Not as much perfume in this candle as in Trapp candles.  Maybe would work better in a smaller room  Nice scent but you're barely aware of it.
3,2018-08-09,"The scent is very pretty, however very light.  Probably best in a small room.  It took 8 hours before the scent showed up."
4,2014-06-07,Smells like fresh flowers. It's not too strong and can fill up a room very quickly.  :)  I'd definitely buy this again.
5,2015-10-28,best fragrance ever!
3,2017-12-30,"Smell is super faint. Not quite what I was expecting from a Yankee candle. Good burn though, you can leave this burning for hours (it lasts a long time)"
4,2016-07-26,light scent & does not over power the room
4,2017-05-19,It's a candle.  Smells good.
4,2018-08-25,Too sweet
3,2021-03-08,It’s my favorite candle but it’s not as fragrant as it is directly from Yankee candle.
2,2021-03-31,Wow! Really strong Scent!!
3,2021-07-19,Not sure how this is supposed to smell like a beach. It is more like strong floral perfume and not in a good way.
4,2017-02-04,Candle arrived much faster than expected.  Smell is great and you can't beat Yankee Candle quality!!!!
1,2021-02-05,No smell. No wonder it was on sale.  I would like my money back or send me another candle to try.  Scented candle should have some smell. Open the top without lighting and there is a faint smell but once lit I get nothing.
3,2020-02-26,"I love the scent of pink sands, but if you're trying to scent up a large room it's barely noticeable. 😫"
4,2017-08-29,as expected
4,2017-02-11,Great scent and it burns forever.
4,2017-09-04,Yankee
5,2014-06-18,Love the smell and it lasts for a long time.  i love to light it and it fills the room.
4,2019-07-02,"Wish lasted longer , otherwise happy"
1,2021-02-08,Terrible scent. I love Yankee candle Lilac but this one smells horrible. It's nothing like the others i have bought. It doesn't even smell like my other one from Yankee of the same sent from before. Chemical stink. Not at all what i had come to expect from this company or this scent.
5,2017-02-24,Excellent
4,2017-08-20,Good smelling
1,2020-04-04,"“Beach Walk” fragrance? Ha! I surely did not smell sand, or an ocean fragrance. My deodorant has more of a fragrance than this candle. These are definitely not TRUE Yankee Candles. These are definitely knock offs. Fakes. Save your money. I’m clearly disappointed."
2,2022-01-01,"The candle I received was super week... I was super disappointed, because I also received a candle from Walmart with in 2 days and that candle was very strong. What made it really bad was my yankee candle from Walmart was smaller..."
2,2020-05-24,"This candle smells great, HOWEVER the scent is no stronger than a Walmart brand candle. Not worth the price!!!!"
2,2020-07-19,"The product itself is nice. Beware of buying it here, though. The jar arrived broken and when I asked for a replacement, that arrived broken as well. Please use better packaging."
4,2013-12-23,Just as advertised. There was a slight scratch on the lid but other thN that it was in perfect condition.
4,2021-04-14,The scent
4,2017-02-01,I like this. But little bit strong smell for me.
4,2016-07-29,yankee candles are still the best made
4,2020-02-19,Nice candle
3,2020-03-09,Great gift. Smell wasnt as good as the name but not bad.
1,2022-05-10,"Candle burns fine but absolutely no scent, very disappointing!!"
4,2018-05-30,Love the lilac scent. Used to have a lilac bush but it died. We now get these candles every spring to remind us of the lilacs we used to have.
1,2022-05-06,"Love Yankee Candles, but this arrived melted and shaped like a blob that doesn't even have a wick or fit in the jar. Smells great but not sure what to do with the blob."
2,2021-07-06,"It's a very nice smelling candle that burns nicely; however, the scent spread is almost non-existent (barely smells while burning). It may be nice for a really small space (like a small bathroom) but noneffective in the kitchen while cooking."
4,2015-09-26,Smells really good. Just not my favorite! & cheaper on here:)
2,2019-08-24,I bought this candle as a gift to my friend since White Gardenia is her favorite scent but it was delivered to me broken! So disappointed!
3,2014-08-18,"This arrived broken. It was not packed right. I chipped the rest of the glass off, put it on a glass plate, I lite the candle and in less then 5 minutes the candle started to split......I noticed that this actually is hollow inside.......it smells great,but I'll never order this through the mail again."
2,2020-07-19,The candle was shattered when I opened the box. I was cut bysome of the shards. Smells great though.
1,2015-12-25,"I just purchased a lavender ""Yankee Candle"" and it's CLEARLY not real. Be weary of paying $25 for a fake candle :("
4,2016-07-10,Scent not so strong but still good quality
1,2018-11-15,"Love this candle... My complaint I paid for what I thought was a larger candle boy was I fooled. The large size is the same and the medium size..  I am ticked off because I paid more for the exact size, candel is just in a different vase/candel holder. I will no longer purchase candels online from this comapany.. Walmart is cheaper as well as Target. Will be going a step further on my complainy due to false info provided. The candel is no bigger than the medium candel tbat I have been purchasing for months.. So disappointed... Zoom in and see the size. Smh"
2,2021-03-02,The jar and lid were cracked. The scent is lovely.
4,2020-03-20,"I didn't love the scent, but that's just my opinion."
1,2022-07-31,The large lilac blossoms candle price seemed to good to be true and that was correct.  It has no scent at all and now I have the hassle of returning it.
3,2021-09-23,This one was decent. Ordered a couple others and they were melted and covered in oil on arrival.
1,2022-05-09,"The first one didn't arrive at all, so then they sent me this one. I guess I'm supposed to dig for the wick? So I'm 0 for 2 with this product, so I recommend not buying this product. Very disappointed."
3,2020-09-30,Received candle and opened it and the wax had melted while the candle was on its side and was all over the lid.
4,2015-06-29,Yankee candle offers the best scents. Their candles also burn for a long time. They also burn even.
4,2016-10-20,Wish it smelled a little bit more.
1,2022-04-25,Love the scent so much! Just broken glass everywhere
5,2015-08-07,Arrived early and smells great!
3,2019-07-02,"Smells more like soap than most yankee candle products. Not bad, and at least it smells clean, but there’s no convincing yourself that you’re in a garden of gardenias."
1,2021-09-05,I like more potent candles. This one hardly smells and the scent it does have is not lilac…
2,2019-01-23,"If you put it in a small room and close the door, you can smell the scent. Otherwise, it has practically no scent at all. Very disappointed with this lack of quality from Yankee Candle. I won't buy this again and probably won't buy another YC unless I can smell it in person first......:("
2,2021-10-27,The scent isn't what I thought it would be and it wasn't very strong while burning.
2,2020-01-13,I mean it definitely burns and sort of smells but NOTHING like my Yankee Candles usually do. I’m used to being able to smell my candle outside of my room and I can barely smell this candle when it sits on my nightstand and I’m in my bed. Total waste of money!
4,2017-04-07,ok
3,2015-11-29,I took a chance.  The majority of people who have entered my house ask what's that smell (in a bad way).  While I love yankee candles.  This one did not come out smelling like a rose.
1,2019-07-21,"I love the smell of the Yankee Candle Pink Sands, which I bought during Amazon Prime Days for a great price. BUT, the 1st candle came melted and with no wick.  I sent it back.  The 2nd candle came with the glass broken. I sent that one back. I ordered a 3rd one. Let's hope the 3rd time is the charm!!"
3,2018-08-09,"Burns well, but the scent isn't very strong. For the investment, somewhat disappointing."
2,2018-10-31,What has happened to the scent? In burning yankee candles you could smell it throughout your home (which I loved.) now I don’t even know I’m burning a candle.
2,2019-09-22,The Lavender candle has no throw at all. I thought Yankee Candle was supposed to be a good brand. But I guess it's back to BBW.
2,2021-02-01,Sorry but this candle has a very weak scent! I am dissatisfied with this candle.
2,2020-07-11,"The candle is beautiful, but the glass is all broken. There is no way to contact vendor, and we can't get new candle unless we send broken one back. The candle is all broken glass and we cannot send back. It would be nice to get a candle that isn't broken. Now we are out the money we spent of a broken candle."
3,2020-12-13,"Unfortunately, three of the 6 I ordered were delivered melted beyond use."
1,2021-03-31,This arrived in Colombia broken.  I explained and was told by Yankee Candle to return.  It was shattered glass and I had tossed it.  They replaced but charged me for the new item PLUS $7 shipping (original order was free shipping) so no more Yankee Candle orders for me!
2,2021-02-09,Way overpricee!
1,2022-08-20,Yankee candles or not what they used to be.I had purchased this candle a few years back while on vacation. So when I sold on Amazon I just had to get it because it had been wonderful. I don’t know if it was old or watt but it wasn’t the same standard that I usually received through this company. Very disappointing.
3,2016-08-27,not as strong oof a lavender scent that I would have liked
1,2022-07-18,Should have actually been a candle…not an air cleaner. Now I have to find a way to print a return label…guess I’ll just end up losing money…again.
1,2020-05-13,I read the reviews and decided to buy this candle because people were saying that it smells like The Bahamas White Sand Beaches ! It DOESN’T! It smells like a whole bunch of NOTHING!!!!!! I let it burn for a whole day and could not smell anything ! NADA! So disappointed! I will go back and buy my Lilac Blossoms!
3,2014-05-16,"It smells like roses. But kind of off. I will have to try Yankee Candles other rose candle I may have confused the two. Overall a pleasing scent, but maybe just a little overwhelming for my small bedroom."
2,2020-03-31,terrible smell. very different than the description. I would never buy again.
1,2021-11-05,I cannot burn this candle more than 5 minutes or I will have an allergy attack because the fragrance is too overpowering. I live in an average sized house. Used in a large room.
3,2019-03-08,It smelled good for the first half of the burning.
1,2020-05-17,"I love the smell of beautiful lilac flowers.  If you like lilacs, you won't like this!  It had an extremely strong, harsh perfume odor that was very irritating.  So irritating that when I held it up to open and smell it, I recoiled and accidentally dropped and smashed the glass container.  What a waste of money!"
1,2021-08-09,Love the candle so I ordered two. UPS left a totally open plastic bag on my porch with only 1 candle inside. I immediately called Amazon and they can’t replace missing items!!! Totally unexpected policy.
1,2019-06-14,"What can one do with a candle that arrived smashed into 100 pieces? The answer, obviously, is nothing! I was so disappointed. And to make matters worse, i could not get a replacement candle sent for some odd reason. Aside from all that the candle doesn't have a pleasant smell. Smelled like some old ladies perfume."
2,2019-11-22,It has no smell. It’s my favorite scent and I can not smell it at all. Was very disappointed.
4,2016-01-07,smells amazing but cracked already?? never had this problem with yankee
4,2014-01-09,"This is a pretty nice candle. Like all Yankee Candles, the candle lasts a very long time. The only thing I wish was different was if the scent was a bit stronger. I can only smell it once I get really close to it."
1,2021-08-20,"The fragrance from this Pink Sand candle causes my wife to cringe. It has a permanent place at our home…OUTSIDE. Take a pass on this purchase, unless you can actually sample this odor before purchase."
4,2020-04-26,Smells amazing
4,2017-12-07,The scent is very nice although it is a bit strong
2,2020-06-13,Too sweet for me but a beautiful color.
3,2018-03-03,It smells great initially but is very weak as a candle. You can't smell it very well when it's burning.
4,2015-07-21,Smells very good  and my mom loves it.
1,2018-08-24,My friend had this white gardenia scent in Yankee candle so I bought this item. Terrible. Nothing like my friend's candle. Smells like bug spray. Waste of money.
1,2020-07-29,"The candle smells lovely but both of the candles I received were broken!! The first one was broken and they sent out another one that was also broken. I ordered it as a gift for someone but I’m glad I had it delivered to me first, good thing. That would not have been a very good gift."
1,2021-08-18,"Yankee candles are not the same anymore. They used to smell amazing and flow through your whole house, now you're lucky if you can smell a large candle burning in a 5x5 bathroom. I will not be buying Yankee candles ever again because the last two that I purchased had no smell whatsoever."
5,2018-04-28,I thought it was big maybe I didn’t pay attention before purchasing it
3,2019-02-14,Did not like it as much as I  thought I would.
2,2022-06-01,I love Yankee candies but this one didn’t really have a smell
3,2020-10-07,Love the scent but candle was shattered when delivered.
2,2020-08-20,"The candle arrived melted into the lid.... Haven't figured out how to light the deformed candle. Smells decent, but doesn't quite have the same fresh bite of real lilacs."
1,2021-08-19,Too bad I bought this thinking it would smell amazing but I was sooo wrong..
2,2020-08-04,"The candle arrived in good condition (I think) but you can barely smell it.  For such an expensive candle, I expected much more.  My home is small and I had the candle in the entryway.  When lit for 30+ minutes, you could barely smell it.I would not recommend."
4,2018-05-06,Not worth the money in comparison to other scented Yankee Candles
1,2021-05-14,"I love this scent which is why I purchased it and purchased an additional one for a gift for Mother's day. When I opened the box, it smelled amazing. However, I am assuming it is old and that is why the price is so low. I lit the candle and there is no smell. I burned it halfway down, which resulted in hours of burning, and I still did not smell anything. I am honestly disappointed. I ended up just purchasing a new one at Yankee candle."
3,2017-09-24,"The fragrance is NOT the same as the ones you can buy In store at Yankee Candle. It was OK, but I won't buy again."
2,2019-07-05,Not the strongest of scents. Smells good but just not strong enough. I can’t tell it’s even burning.
4,2018-03-25,I love this fragrance
3,2021-01-10,Smells great and arrived quickly but the glass was broken. A little disappointing but it still does it’s job.
1,2020-12-31,Candle released black film all over my newly redone master bathroom. Trimmed candle wick as directed but candle still. Coated walls and even toilet seat! I purchased 2 of these candles and I have never had a problem with Yankee Candle before.
4,2015-01-19,Smells awesome ...good quality.
4,2019-01-13,"I like it, it has a wonderful smell and you can light it many times!"
1,2021-04-28,It might have been a fluke on this candle but I couldn't keep it lit it sparked tried a warmer it just popped candle wax everywhere. But I've always loved this brand. Has great scent like I said probably a fluke
3,2015-12-09,The smell is true... the only reason I have gave it 3 stars is because it came broken. This is a gift mailed directly to the person. Trying to work with someone else having them mail it back has proven to be nothing more then a headache since I don't own a printer to print out a new shipping label to return it Amazon from another state..
1,2020-07-18,"It's really upsetting that it's broken. The glass is everywhere. I just did my surgery, and I wanted candles to relax. But it seems impossible. I also got my fingers cut because of the glass. I don't want to go to the store to return them, I can't really move and I don't feel safe to go to public area. Really sad, hope someone can help."
1,2020-12-13,"The driver delivered about 10 minutes ago.  I mistakenly said “arrived in the mail” in the video.  It has a nice scent,  but melted without a visible wick, it can’t be used.  Would like a refund.  Other similar candles were fine."
1,2021-01-13,"Once again, I received my Yankee Candle and am very disappointed!  I don't understand why there is no scent.  I am used to the candle being very strong in EVERY scent I bought!  Even if I go to the Yankee Candle store, it is the same thing.  I miss the old Yankee Candle scents!"
4,2018-10-11,Snelt good but burnt to quickly
1,2022-06-22,I'm not sure this is a real Yankee candle. It smokes like crazy and is burning very fast. Disappointed ☹️
2,2020-10-28,Always had a good experience with yankee candle. This scent is very weak like the cover was left off for a while.
2,2021-01-08,Small
1,2022-08-09,"Candle had melted then rehardened by time of delivery.  Smelled awful,  nothing Like lilacs.  Could of just been a flawed candle, I don't know."
2,2022-05-07,The scent for this candle wasn't strong like normal.
2,2021-03-04,This scent wasn’t strong at all and doesn’t linger.  Won’t buy this again
3,2021-05-03,The glass for the candle is broke. I have sent this info 3 times now. No response!!
4,2015-08-06,Nice summer scent.
1,2020-04-06,Well I’m sorry to say it was broke when received.I heard the broken glass as I picked it up.I ordered along with another one which came delivered yesterday it was perfect.  But really I can understand with the volume of packages that are being delivered today !The scent is great .... I’ll try again when this crisis is over .....Thank you and STAY SAFE TO ALL THE WORKERS !
1,2021-11-25,I buy Yankee candles cuz of the smell I like a strong smelling candle but this one disappointed I bought a Yankee candle the rose scent  it smells wonderful will not buy the scent again!!😒
4,2015-07-18,nice clean smell
1,2022-03-20,Extremely disappointed with the Midnight Jasmine. Nearly $30 for a candle that reminds you of cheap air freshener spray.
4,2015-08-01,Strong and Fresh :)
1,2021-07-31,"Much to my horror, I found that the candle was leaving soot behind in every part of the house. I received a quote to remove the soot. $20,000! Someone please tell Jeff that the quality of his merchandise is going down, down down. As for the moon, I'd like to give this candle a free trip to the moon at the end of my foot."
3,2018-06-19,Would have really enjoyed a stronger scent.
2,2019-05-11,Very disappointed by this candle.  The strength of the scent was much weaker than I expected.
1,2018-11-03,"So disappointed with this purchase. This is my favorite candle scent.  I've bought this candle several times from the store. Almost immediately you can smell the scent coming off the candle.  This time there is almost no scent what so ever.  I burned it for hours and still it is so faint,  if anything at all.  Must be defective or something. Something is definitely wrong. Waste of money."
1,2020-05-05,"Feels like a knock off. Doesn’t fill the room, barely smell it, burns really fast. Think it’s a fake."
1,2022-03-29,"I own many different Yankee Candles and can smell them all. This one, not so much...at all. Very disappointed."
4,2020-07-27,At least it smells good.
2,2019-08-11,I’m disappointed at this gardenia scent! It does not smells like it all!
3,2018-03-02,If you like a very faint smell then this candle is for you.  I will not buy this scent again as I like a stronger fragrance like Wedding Day.
4,2015-01-01,Great smell. Just wish it was cheaper.
4,2020-01-28,The smell was amazing it lasted what it felt like forever. Definitely recommend.
2,2021-12-14,"Yankee Candles generally have a good, strong smell, even when not lit. This one however, I can barely smell even when super close to it. I don't recommend this scent."
2,2020-06-05,there is no scent from this candle.
2,2021-12-28,The scent gave me a HEADACHE.
4,2015-01-10,Smells good
2,2019-10-08,"I was disappointed with scent or I should say,lack of scent."
1,2020-09-04,"This candle was not a Yankee candle brand candle. It was cheap was, it smelled like my grandmother's perfume not pleasant and it didn't burn even but instead burned a hole into the candle straight down the wick leaving the majority of the candle."
2,2021-04-04,"Although I love Yankee Candles and a rose scent,  this one is a bit over powering."
2,2021-03-27,I’m never buying non-soy candles again
4,2020-01-13,I love it and I gave it for a gift to my daughter !!
1,2016-09-12,RECEIVED CRUSHED.
4,2015-07-10,none
1,2020-07-20,I was really looking forward to using this candle. I guess sitting in a HOT Delivery Truck not a good idea. The candle must have been laying on it's side because the wax was melted to the top of the candle lid. The wick isn't even visible.
5,2017-03-04,Smells just like a rose
3,2020-10-25,nice
3,2021-04-15,"Less intense than the DW Home ""Merci"" White Gardenias."
2,2022-01-21,Smells like mosquito dope!
4,2014-02-03,Generally in satisfied with the quality and scent of Yankee Candles. I do find that these candles will not give you an intense fragrance for a room.
1,2021-04-22,Candle isn't even halfway burned and the wick won't stay lit anymore. Absolute joke of a product. Won't ever buy another commercially made candle again. Etsy here I come.
3,2020-09-14,Was looking forward to smelling this.  Item broken.
1,2019-04-15,"Highly disappointed in this product! I’ve burnt Yankee Candles before and have never had an experience like this...  There’s constant black smoking coming from the wick when lit (no matter how many times and how short I trim it).  Also, the flame from the wick is easily about 4 inches tall and at least two inches outside the top of the jar.  I honestly can’t even leave the room for 1 minute when it’s lit because I’m afraid somehow a fire will start.  This purchase is definitely among my top worst Amazon purchase."
3,2020-01-02,Lost its scent to early. Only burned once and after that scent was gone
1,2022-04-21,"Doesn't emit any sort of scent. And yes, I am COVID negative."
3,2015-04-17,"While advertised as being the (apparently discontinued) honeysuckle scent, this candle actually turned out to be some kind of french vanilla. Not what I wanted."
1,2021-10-09,I have bought many Yankee candles and in particular this scent as it fills the room even when it isn't lit.  I am very disappointed in this purchase as this candle has absolutely no scent at all.  If it didn't come in a Yankee candle box I would think it is a fake.  I will never purchase from this seller again
3,2012-09-07,"My sense of smell isn't that good, but I can't really smell this as well as the other reviewers say. I just kind of smell burnt candle. Not bad but not mindblowing."
3,2018-07-27,Scent was ok not for me but decent candle
1,2021-12-01,"This candle smells bad. It smells like church incense, not lavender or vanilla. I threw it straight in the garbage. Eeek. Buyer beware."
2,2013-12-18,wasn't impressed at all with this candle.  it smells more herbal than like fresh cut grass.  I was expecting more from yankee candles.  pissed I spent the money on a crappy candle.
1,2019-06-07,The glass was broken and unsalvageable to be able to use upon arrival.  We threw it away so nobody would get cut handling it.  I'm not returning broken glass shards but want a refund or replacement
1,2021-03-24,Scent Too strong and not pleasant.The wick produces a lot of smoke.
1,2021-03-06,This candle has hardly no scent. It's a ridiculously priced candle that I can buy a long lasting candle in a dollar store for a dollar. Never again will I buy a Yankee Candle.
3,2017-09-17,"Smells good, burns long... EXPENSIVE."
3,2018-04-18,The smell wasn't very strong or powerful.  :(  But arrived safe!
1,2021-09-15,"I heard glass as soon as I picked the box up, too lazy to return it and I’d rather use it than the company throw it out, first time trying to buy a candle online and if I’m feeling dangerous I’ll try again"
1,2021-08-13,"I initially was very happy with this candle; however after burning less than an eighth of the candle the wick became so short that the candle will not light and cannot be used.  In order to use any of it I am going to have to scrape the jar, buy a wick and make a new candle.  This is very disappointing as I had heard great things about Yankee Candles."
3,2018-04-17,Smells great in the jar.  Fragrance sort of faint when lit.
4,2018-08-22,Smells wonderful...would definitely recommend.
1,2019-10-17,This review is based on scent. The candle smells great when it’s not lit. Once you light the candle it has no scent to it. I allowed my candle to burn for 1 hour to see if I would be able to smell something and nothing.
4,2017-01-22,great.
3,2017-02-07,The oils from the candle leaked out all over the packaging so the candle didn't have a very strong scent.
1,2020-06-22,How this candle received positive reviews is beyond me.  It has NO smell.  Smells like wax burning.  Such a huge disappointment.
3,2015-02-23,The smell is actually quite faint.  I've had better luck with Jasmine candles I've purchased from Home Goods.  I will not be buying this again.
3,2017-10-30,Just okay. Doesn't compare to Tyler brand for fragrance.
1,2021-05-12,Very disappointed. No scent. Just smells like a plain candle burning.
3,2021-04-23,Vague scent; not as strong as other manufacture I've purchase from before.
3,2019-06-20,Not enough scent.
1,2021-07-09,Although the candle smells nice-the glass bottle top got hot enough to crack and break leaving jagged edges when the candle was being used
3,2019-07-21,Smell
1,2022-03-10,My candle was delivered broken in tiny shards of glass. I want to have it replaced.
1,2022-07-16,This candle was melted when arrived. So disappointed
3,2017-08-10,very strong.  But I love Yankee Candle....just not one of my favs
1,2022-03-14,This candle was delivered to me ..with the top part of the glass BROKEN!!!
1,2022-01-12,There's barely any scent and my gift was late because the first one came completely shattered!!!
1,2022-01-12,"Ordered this for a friend for Xmas, glass was broken,  no damage to box.  Ok, returned it for exchange,  it came in broken also, no damage to box. Returned it and gave up, both times I went to UPS to return my truck smelled great from the candle."
1,2021-09-02,"I was beyond disappointed when I opened my candle and the wax was above the top of the candle. I was looking forward to this, but now I may not order it online ever again for fear this will happen again"
4,2019-10-04,Loved the smell of the candle but unfortunately it was broke when it arrived 💔🙄😴
2,2020-07-26,We have been buying Yankee Candles for over 15 years and these candles burns way too quick. They do not last as long as the Yankee Candles bought from the Yankee Candle store
2,2020-07-17,"This was such a wonderful smell, but I couldn't even fully open the box because the entire candle jar was shattered in delivery. There was not even any bubble wrap inside the box. So disappointed."
2,2019-08-07,Not happy... Scent wasn't strong at all.
3,2018-02-17,Not one of favorites. Very faint smell.
3,2018-04-26,Smell is ok. Won’t knock your socks off.
3,2022-02-03,Smells like bubble gum..
3,2020-05-22,This candle lasted a long time but didn’t have much of a scent when burning.
5,2017-10-28,Great
1,2021-10-17,Received candle glass cracked in several places. Unable to use. Very disappointed with delivery
1,2020-09-16,If l could have given this 0 stars that rating would have been warranted. This item was delivered twice each time the glass jar was broken. Scary when you hear glass rattling in the box.  The good thing was I'll be refunded but only after the defective product received back to Amazon. I did not get my full refund. Taxes paid for not equal taxes refunded.
3,2019-12-15,The candle was a great value but the scent was very subtle.
1,2021-05-25,"Yuck. The top notes were very artificial lilac; sweeter than the real thing, the base notes were of singed chemicals. Nope. Trashed it."
3,2020-11-14,I really Love this product the scent OF this candle really smell good
2,2016-03-08,"I got a different scent pink sands if my last review posted sorry I was just upset at the moment, really wanted the rose scent ill give the one I got away to someone"
1,2021-03-15,I always burned Yankee Candles and have been pleased with them.  I put this in a small bathroom with the door closed and could barely smell it.  A HUGE waste of money.  The fragrance was pleasant but barely there.  Will never buy this again and it makes me wonder...has Yankee Candle changed the quality of their candles?
4,2016-03-24,love it
1,2020-12-19,This scent isn't as bad as Fresh Cut Roses but perhaps the paraffin is the reason for my headaches.  It doesn't take long for the smell to become uncomfortable.  Perhaps my allergies are a factor but I do have other candles that don't seem to have the same effect.
1,2020-06-27,"See comment on the other candle I bought. Don’t care for them.Overpriced,poor quality wicks wasn’t in the center of candle.I have been buying and burning candles for many years.Yankee doesn’t have the same good quality it use too 😟"
1,2021-05-30,Returning this candle because it fills the room with smoke. I have trimmed the wicks multiple times. Tired is messing with it ;( Going with a different brand.
1,2020-12-13,"I always thought Yankee Candle was the best money could buy, but I noticed a large amount of black smoke from my Yankee Candle, so I did some research. Turns out that Yankee uses paraffin wax, which is derived from a petroleum by-product, and so while these candles smell nice (before you extinguish them), burning these are like running little diesel engines inside your home. No thank you. Soy wax or beeswax from now on."
3,2016-11-29,"The smell is great, but definitely not worth the price. I bought other candles of half price and same quality."
1,2022-03-08,Don’t buy the lilac one it literally smells like cat piss.
3,2018-06-11,Yankee candles dont smell as pungent as they used to.
2,2014-08-25,"Candle arrived late (due to rain) and was 1/4 melted with no visible wick to burn it.  I will use it on a ""warmer"" as the sentis exactly what I wanted and not willing to pay to return it."
2,2013-11-27,"This was my first time purchasing a yankee candle. I ordered this one because of the high reviews so my expecations were high, and sadly I was very disappointed. I can hardly smell the candle. Will not purchase a gain."
1,2020-08-03,"Right when i picked up the box I knew something was wrong. I heard noises inside which was unusual since this is a candle...there should not be clinking noises. The candle was inside the candle holder, in the yankee candle box, in an amazon box with two  “airplus” bags. Not sure how it could have broken like this but it did. Pretty disappointed as it was supposed to be a gift for someone. Wish they could have done better. Be aware this is a possibility when ordering this through amazon. Something to think twice about."
3,2018-07-31,The smell is very nice and light. It came melted and I had to dig the wick out destroying the top of the candle.
1,2019-02-20,"What a rip-off and BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I burned this candle for 2 days! Once on my dresser but couldn't smell anything! I then moved it to my enclosed bathroom for several hours but still couldn't smell anything! I'd expect this from a lesser brand cheaper candle, but not Yankee! I was all excited because this was supposed to be a new scent! What a let down! 😤👎🏽"
5,2017-06-15,great gift
4,2019-12-13,Yankee candles are a bit expensive.
1,2021-05-04,This candle smelled of nothing except heated wax. Extremely disappointing.
1,2019-07-24,"This candle has no scent. It smells like lit up wax. I’ve never been so disappointment in a purchase in my life, it’s definitely because of the cost and because it’s a Yankee candle, I would return it but have thrown away all the packaging.Don't purchase this scent."
1,2019-12-04,"I smelled this candle (enchanted moon) at Walmart and kept it on my wishlist until Black Friday when it was on sale. The candle I received barely even smelled, and did not smell ANYTHING like the exact same candle at Walmart. The one I received is perfume-y and gross."
4,2019-07-08,Great smell! Unfortunately my candle came broken so I'm pretty bummed about that!
3,2020-01-08,"I think, by the scent, it is old"
1,2021-01-02,This did not ship well... must have melted during shipping. All the wax shifted to one side and the wick is not even visible. Smells great though.
2,2019-04-12,Barely any scent. Would not buy again.
1,2022-05-11,The candle was delivered melted
1,2022-06-05,Came smashed and broken. Annoyed.
4,2013-09-03,Never had this candle scent before and it is really nice.  The aroma just taking the lid off is strong and I love the color.  It fits in great in the room I am using it.  Thanks Amazon!
1,2020-12-12,"Not a nice smell...I can't tell what it's supposed to smell like, but whatever it is isn't very pleasant... it's kind of bitter smelling. That being said, you really can't go wrong with Yankee Candles. They're great smelling (usually) and burn for a very long time. You definitely get more bang for the buck. Nice for gifting!"
2,2020-01-06,Not the best scent
1,2018-12-03,"I keep hearing how great Yankee candles are. I've tried several and am always disappointed. Someone suggested I try this scent and I wouldn't be disappointed. Wrong. The candles do not burn evenly, and the wick is not strong, so a waste of wax. I'm sticking to Shorties candles. Best I've found so far."
1,2021-02-05,This candle is so pretty and I reorderedBut it has no smell as I realized nowWhich is the purpose of a Yankee candle ..!
4,2020-04-09,Broken glass everywhere!!!
1,2021-10-15,"I love the smell of this candle. Not all did it take a week to arrive, but  the candle came shattered."
1,2022-08-04,Candle had no scent
2,2022-02-28,I enjoyed the scent but it’s a completely different than the one I decided to purchase.
1,2021-07-29,No smell darn!
2,2022-06-04,You can barely smell anything. Not worth the money.
2,2020-08-19,Little to no scent.
1,2020-11-11,"The candle didn’t burn properly. It created a large black smoke that stained my wall and no matter what, it failed to go away. I had to throw the whole thing away. As expensive as these are. What a waste."
2,2019-06-23,Does NOT stay lit.
1,2018-06-29,Don’t like the smell. If you want a good smelling Jasmine candle try Golden Jasmine from Bath&Body. Also came very melted and I had to use a torch to find the wick. That’s my fault for ordering in summer I guess.
3,2020-02-02,Candle smells great however it was shattered and in a million pieces. Wouldn’t even want to send back cause I would be afraid someone would cut themself 😢
2,2020-07-28,Scent is not strong AT ALLBurns extremely fastCheaply produces wickNot worth the money
2,2020-07-25,The smell is amazing but when this candle arrived its was melted this way. Other candles that I had in the particular order were not affected besides this one. I'm not sure what to do with this haha.
2,2020-07-27,Glass jar broken... I will try to melt it and transfer into another jar. Smells lovely.
1,2020-11-17,I love Yankee candles when you can actually smell the scent of them.  The candle we are burning now we can't smell at all!  I think this was a replacement candle for another candle we got which melted all over the box or another one that arrived with a broken glass around the candle.  These are expensive candles so they definitely should have a scent to them.
2,2022-07-22,"Smells great, arrived broken"
5,2014-07-12,I love Yankee Candles!!! But this one is now my favorite.  It leaves your room smelling like its filled with fresh cut roses.
2,2020-11-03,Definitely expected more out of a brand like this. It’s the equivalent of a standard unscented candle that you can find at the local market for $1
1,2022-05-02,"I do not know who is at fault, but when I opened the package the candle jar was broken"
3,2017-07-21,fragrance too weak
1,2022-01-03,"This is the first bad experience with a Yankee candle and I use them for over 20 years. When burning, the candle produced a heavy black smoke; so bad that the white fur on my white Bichon Maltese became gray. This candle shows it was made in Czech Republic so I wonder if the quality is different than the ones made in US."
2,2019-05-10,Not as nice as the review I read.
3,2017-09-01,Scent is very faint.
1,2022-04-22,Bothered my allergies.
1,2021-03-29,My daughter has purchased this candle in the past and has enjoyed it however when I ordered the exact same product when it arrived there was no wick. We even took a metal spoon and attempted to dig a little to see if the wick had just been buried in the wax and we were not able to find the wick. Very disappointed does not even begin to cover how I feel right now
1,2020-12-20,Looks like someone either put a sun and sand label on another jar. Or someone poured another candle into a sun and sand jar. Disrespectful!
1,2021-08-06,"Smells very floral. If you like floral scents you will love this candle. I do not like floral scents and I don’t think a walk on the beach should smell anything like flowers. When I think of floral scents, I think of grandmas house. I love my grandma but I don’t want my house to smell like her."
1,2021-12-03,I have been buying this candles for decades! Yankees products got changed. They don’t have that smell anymore. The candle doesn’t even smell at all.They lost their quality
4,2015-09-18,I LIKE IT
1,2020-10-28,Unable to use candle because it was damaged upon arrival.  Tried but candle would not light
3,2020-04-26,This candle han scent my wife is displeased
1,2020-07-04,Do not buy Yankee candles from amazon. There is no dicount. This candle has no color and no scent and a faded picture on the front of the candle. It was very old. Buy from Yankee you can get some good deals. The scent was sold out. It is my favorite. Now nothing but wasted money!
1,2022-05-12,No smell at all
3,2016-06-06,Candle did not burn evenly leaving to much of the candle left in the jar.
1,2021-10-26,"As pictured, the wax was somehow completely up inside the lid. The entire side of the jar is empty. Can’t see a wick. I don’t even understand how this was sent out."
1,2021-04-19,"It does last well. However, we all found the smell overwhelming. Lilacs on steroids! Would not recommend."
2,2020-05-23,This did not smell like gardenia at all. It just smells like floral and perfume. Disappointed.
4,2015-09-18,FAIR DEAL
1,2021-01-06,There’s no noticeable scent to this burning candle unless all the soot that’s in my nasal cavity (from burning this candle) is preventing me from actually being able to detect any scent. Can’t imagine what’s settling in my lungs and I live in Los Angeles. Before you ask I Definitely don’t have COVID.
1,2021-08-17,Disappointed the lilac scent was not there. Just a purple non scented one
2,2019-01-13,"The sent smells like chemicals. It makes me cough and my nose run, despite I’ve never had this reaction with other candles. No problems with the shipping or packaging."
3,2020-09-21,I expected it to be more fragrant.
3,2020-02-29,"I have been wanting this flavor for awhile. Sweet scent, kinda a seeet berry smell. Would definitely gift it."
1,2021-08-06,The media could not be loaded.
3,2020-02-01,Candle smells so good but the top of the candles glass was broken. Obviously still useable but need to work on better packaging.
4,2013-03-27,"It has long life, burns evenly.Smells terrific, however the scent is very strong, it may not be good for a small room."
3,2016-11-26,"Long lasting, but very subtle aroma."
2,2022-03-22,Scent too strong
5,2015-01-27,Mmmmm
3,2016-03-26,Not a powerful scent. Tyler candles are better.
3,2016-06-07,"better to buy these at walmart.. product good, price was too high"
2,2016-04-14,"Smelled great, but the idea of soot in the house was a turn-off. I returned these and bought soy based candles instead!"
1,2022-07-07,Terrible artificial aroma.
1,2021-11-18,"Product glass jar was shattered on arrival. Box was fine.  Attempted to use return/replace on Amazon site indicating the box was fine but the product was damaged. Each attempt resulted in being stuck in a loop. I’m unable to get a replacement which I would prefer, or a refund. Extremely dissatisfied."
1,2021-07-24,I have been buying scented candles from Yankee candle for 10 years now and they always lasted nearly a month. This one lasted barely 4 days and had no scent to it at all. Not at all worth what I paid for it.
3,2018-12-12,"Not a strong smell, which I like"
1,2022-05-16,No wick.  Can’t burn
1,2021-12-14,"Waste of money, in my opinion. Can not smell the candle at all. Very disappointed."
1,2020-02-17,This came to me shattered in tiny pieces with glass shards falling out of the box. I’m trying to figure out how to take this box to Kohl’s for return without getting glass everywhere.
3,2020-09-30,"Missing from 1st delivery, Broken in second..."
2,2015-06-01,"Weak scent.  Given what I paid for this, it expected a more noticeable scent.  Unless I am close enough to feel the flame's heat, I'm not smelling anything."
1,2022-07-22,"What did I buy this for ? In case power goes out at night?This thing has absolutely no scent, and I dont have or ever had Covid."
3,2018-04-06,"Loved the aroma at fist, the more I used it the less it seems to have any aroma at all."
1,2022-03-06,"It came completely defective and the wax settled to one side, it’s un usable - smelled good but I feel like an idiot for purchasing - wondering if I could get a new one but what a dissapointment"
1,2022-05-09,"Not giftable… looks like a candle I could’ve gotten at the Dollar Store since there was zero labels or sticker label on it, as shown. Very disappointed since this isn’t a cheap candle and it doesn’t even say Yankee Candle on it."
3,2021-04-18,The scent is too strong
2,2015-05-03,all I can smell is the candle wax had a friend over and that's she could smell also. could done the same at walmarts $5.00 a jar candles
1,2020-09-04,MY Beach walk candle Picture says it all 🤦🏾‍♀️very dissatisfied with the way it arrived I will be resending this back I do love how it came super fast after ordering it salted caramel seems a bit rushed in making it as well 🤦🏾‍♀️
2,2017-12-08,Candle was stored up side down. Melted up side down. Not usuable. Scent was weak as well.
1,2020-06-25,First delivery broken. Glass everywhere.  This one insanely melted and unuseable. I just opened it...too late to get a refund. What a rip off!!
3,2019-12-15,I purchase these candles as Christmas gifts. But 2 of the 4 candles I received came broken. I am very disappointed at this point!!!!
2,2019-12-08,Arrived in broken pieces
2,2020-07-17,So I had bought this little gift for my GF because she loves Lilacs and well since it came in broken the top is broken and the glass is cracked so I don't know if I can even light this.
2,2014-10-30,"Transplanted to Texas 30 years ago, but I still remember the amazing scent.  I miss lilacs terribly.This didn't fill the hole."
1,2020-05-02,"Opened the box only to find glass shattered and the entire top half of the glass encasing broken.... The box doesn't look damaged or shoe signs of being dropped, however the mold that this candle was in shows it was clearly broken from being dropped. Going to have to find a way to light this thing with some kind of glass jar that can hold it."
1,2020-07-27,"Wish i could give a real review about the smell and longevity of this candle but unfortunately mine came in broken. All i can said is that it does smells good, right when i opened the box i could smelled already. Now im returning this one and waiting for a replacement. I will update my review then."
1,2020-05-19,I LOVE yankee candles especially The Pink sands scent BUT unfortunately both of the candles I bought here gave off ZERO scent.Very disappointed
2,2021-07-08,It has no smell
4,2019-02-08,The size is nice to keep using long but smell is like watermelon
1,2022-02-13,So very disappointing. This candle did not even have a scent when I opened the jar. Waste of money. I used to love Yankee candles. The last two I purchased were very poor quality. Fool me once shame on you....fool me twice shame on me.
2,2018-01-13,Barely any fragrance at all. Wish I could return them.
1,2020-06-09,"This candle arrived late, AND was leaking all over its cardboard packaging. It turned into liquid and I can’t even fish out the wick if I wanted to without mangling the whole thing. It’s an end of the year teacher gift, too, so I’m not too thrilled right now."
1,2019-10-05,This doesn't smell like the beach at all. Unless your idea of the beach smells like an old lady's bathroom 😂. Can't believe I fell for this crap. Smells like Jean Natae perfume. Terrible.
4,2018-10-25,Simply amazing candle
3,2018-08-04,It was melted upon arrival. Thier scents have gotten weaker. I am going to try soy based candles.
3,2014-08-21,Love Yankee candles to have on hand for a quick gift I might have forgot about or just to put out in my own home. However this is one item you can ALWAYS get considerably cheaper in store or on their website!
4,2018-02-11,"Scent is nice, but not very noticeable."
1,2022-07-12,Product was not on my port h for more than 2 minutes it was completely melted unusable
3,2017-02-23,Wonderful!
2,2018-06-17,Nice sent but not a strong scent....
2,2021-06-15,"This candle does not have a strong aroma, would not recommend"
1,2022-07-01,"There's only little fragrance, the same as what you buy in dollar store $3.99. what a waste of money."
1,2021-11-25,"Needed a candle of a specific diameter for holder, this said it was the right size but when it came is was 1/2 inch smaller diameter, disappointed."
1,2022-01-16,Not what I was looking for.
3,2020-09-06,Does not give a strong enough aroma for me.
1,2021-01-13,"It barely has any scent! Since I have used it, I am not sure if I can still return it. Very disappointed."
1,2022-02-25,
3,2016-12-07,Glass shattered
3,2016-08-15,Candle was leaking
1,2022-05-08,"Candle was supposed to be a Mother’s Day gift but it arrived melted into the lid, and warped to the point that the wick couldn’t be detected nor the lid able to come off (wax melted into lid….). Very disappointed"
1,2019-11-09,It came completely melted sideways! Awful. I will never order again because now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. It’s not allowing me to post a pic of this mess.
1,2022-01-29,Not the best!
3,2016-06-07,great scent but prices better at walmart
1,2020-04-18,"This candle's scent is wonderful, however, the jar was broken in transit and I need to ?return? it for a refund???!!!  Really??!!  Why would they want it back just to throw it away?"
2,2022-03-30,Arrived completely broken 😣
1,2021-02-12,I ordered 2 Lilac candles the boxes both say Lilac on them. I opened them and they are both Pink Sands. I was very disappointed. Lilac was what I purchased and it my all time favorite scent. This is the first time this has ever happened to me.
2,2018-06-06,Did not like the smell.
1,2020-12-06,Budget option for candle lovers. Disappointed with the smells . Not smelling as advertised.
1,2020-03-30,"This was a waste of purchase if you like jasmine scent. You can smell the jasmine if you are just smelling the wax, but when you burn it there is no jasmine scent, not even a subtle hint of it. I lit it in a small room with door closed and it didn't even smell like jasmine or like anything else. Very disappointed."
4,2015-09-04,Good quality! One of my favorite scents.
1,2013-05-08,"Nice candle...sent to my daughter ....TOO BAD THE THOUGHTFUL CARD WAS ADDRESSED TO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON FOR A DIFFERENT HOLIDAY...HOPE AUNT AMY (?).. ISNT TOO DISAPPOINTED,"
3,2014-10-26,sad to say but the quality isn't what it used to be. I'm no longer a fan.
1,2020-07-26,"This is second broken (glass) candle I have received. There is no found method to request another replacement, or, money back."
1,2021-01-03,This candle smells like absolutely positively NOTHING! I will definitely not purchase this again.
3,2014-12-11,Nice scent and candle but a little expensive.
1,2018-12-26,I got the wrong candle.. instead of bothering with a return I just gave it to someone for a Christmas present. Kind of disappointed I was really looking forward to the pink sands.
1,2022-01-06,Looks melted on top I got 2 one is ok but this one no good
2,2021-08-25,"Scent was great at first, but it lost scent right away"
1,2021-03-14,Scent is nothing. Just my room. Finally splurged and I'm sorry!!!!!
2,2018-02-20,Doesn't smell like much.
1,2021-03-07,I thinks I got a bad jar because my had no scent like it did before.
1,2012-12-12,"Candle was the right one, but the jar was broken.  They need to do a much better job packaging them, and use tape to hold the plastic around the product."
1,2021-11-14,"came with a mold on it!!! wtf?!?!! on 4 different candles!If i'm burning the candle while having mold on it, It means I need to breath itThis is so upsetting!! I will ask for a refund but for now I would'nt recommend buing for sure!"
1,2020-06-06,The candle arrived with shattered glass. They did replace it for me. The second one came with the wax all lopsided to one side. I can’t even light it.
2,2019-12-26,"They are ok.they just do not have a Long burn time. They also are not as big as they appear ,so beware!!😒"
2,2018-01-15,Smells funny. Don't like it
1,2021-10-02,Never buy this one again.  It does not last and it’s not a great scent
1,2020-09-22,"Scent not noticeable, possible old ? Very unhappy, Yankee candles are usually fragrant, this is not!"
4,2019-02-02,I will definitely buy this again!!
3,2021-01-31,Can barely smell the scent
3,2019-03-23,Minimal scent
2,2017-09-18,Very little smell to it- burning or not
1,2020-05-18,"HORRIBLE JUST HORRIBLE! GARBAGE I BOUGHT 3 YANKEE CANDLES ALL 3 HAVE NO SCENT.  WEDDING DAY,  BEACH WALK AND SUN AND SAND."
2,2017-08-10,I must have gotten one out of the BAD batch. I barely smell this one.
1,2020-07-26,"Well, the first one was melted with no wick in sight.The replacement was broke upon arrival.I’ll go to the store and buy one."
2,2017-06-19,it came broken three candles
1,2021-05-02,Try village candles instead betterThe black smoke is ridiculous but village candles burn clean
5,2014-10-28,A gift for my brother in law it reminds him of home :)
1,2021-02-22,"Burns fat, VERY faint scent unlike when you buy from Yankee Candle"
3,2015-05-21,Not too much fragrance!
1,2020-07-08,2 separate orders and both broken.  The smell is amazing though but I must have received a batch that was damaged.
2,2020-12-16,Poor smell
1,2022-01-03,I was glad it came in 2 days early but now that I c it’s broke I lost all excitement. This usually happens whenever I buy cheap candles but I would’ve never expected this from yankee candle. I’m done.
1,2022-01-05,
2,2020-07-19,Glass jar arrived broken.
2,2020-05-04,Does not have a scent..might be an old candle. I would recommend buying from a store instead.
2,2019-03-30,Use it in my bedroom but no smell.
2,2020-05-28,No wick visible.
3,2015-11-02,Nice aroma.
4,2018-03-14,My candle was  broken when  it arrived the jar wasTotally damage
1,2020-09-02,This candle came in a Yankee Candle box but it wasn't a Yankee Candle.  It's an Aromascape Lavender Vanilla.  It's scent is weak and it burns unevenly.
4,2017-01-04,gift
2,2021-01-15,There was no scent in this candle
3,2018-03-27,I love Yankee but I did not care for this scent at all.
1,2020-06-05,I have purchased pinks sand from the actual Yankee store and it is an amazing candle. But the candle that I purchased on amazon has absolutely no scent.
4,2016-03-21,"I love this candle, smells so good"
2,2014-03-31,"I was looking for a fragrance to fill my small living room.  I typically buy Mystic House candles but wanted to try these due to the high reviews on the smell.  It is true that they smell great but you have to be literally hovering over the candle to smell it.  If you need this fragrance to noticeably fill a room, this is not the candle for you."
1,2022-07-22,"The wicks refuse to stay lit. When the wicks finally do burn, it's such a small flame that you can barely notice that it's there. I've never had this problem with a Yankee Candle before, but it's unusable."
3,2016-08-17,Fragrance is very strong. Good after using kitchen
1,2015-05-31,It's smells stale and like old musty perfume.
1,2019-07-24,This candle can’t be a genuine yankee candle. All yankee candles have a strong smell that will fill up a room this candle doesn’t even smell at all. Total rip off
1,2020-02-12,came broken in many pieces. I have bought many but now my 2nd broken yankee arrival. I will buy when i go shopping so it is not in pieces.
1,2018-01-31,"Not for me. I was hoping for more of a ""beach"" scent...a little coconut, a little tropical fruit, and a little floral. But this candle is ALL FLORAL. Like ridiculously strong old lady perfume. It gave me a headache just sitting it on the table near me. Never even lit it. It may be exactly what some folks are looking for but not me."
1,2018-03-21,"This candle was pretty and smelled wonderful before it was lit. After lighting it, it was like a assult on the senses. The smell made me feel like I was eating it, then it gave me a headache, upset stomach! Not a winner in my book."
1,2021-01-20,Weak fragrance. Yankee Candle quality has decreased.
1,2020-08-14,"Really disappointed, was really looking forward too the scent and I smell nothing."
1,2021-09-16,This candle has no scent to it at all....What a waste!
1,2021-12-06,These candles are unusable. They came melted and without wicks. I’m also not able to request new ones or get my money back. DO NOT PURCHASE
2,2016-07-02,smelling is good. but black smog comes out too much.
1,2020-05-14,Unfortunately I am very disappointed that I received my candle today and it is warped to the point that i cannot even find the wick to light it. It looks like the candle was upside down and formed to the top so that the wick is buried and wax is oozing out of the top.I was very excited to to get my new candle and waited weeks for it and to my disappointment i cannot even use it now.
1,2022-06-21,Was delivered completely shattered. The candle was and still is packaged in two boxes. Yet it has glass shards jingling around.
1,2022-05-05,Threw it and broken glass away
1,2019-02-17,I purchased Clean Cotton and Beach Walk. Both barely have any scent at all. I sometimes buy their cheaper brand from the drug store and they have way more scent. Will stick with those in the future rather than blowing my money on the original Yankee Candles. I'm not even convinced that this is real product unless it has greatly declined in quality?
2,2017-08-01,Seemed second quality. Lots of air in wax and popping.
1,2020-05-08,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 Top was broken and box full of glass. It smells wonderful though sadly. Requesting a return/replacement."
3,2018-01-12,Gardenia was my mothers favorite flower but as a candle the flame gives off a burning scent...not pleasant! trim the wick and your good to go..
2,2018-04-12,"love yankee, but this sent is like burning cologne."
1,2019-11-08,"Very little sent at all. It was lit time in about 5 hours the second time and in a small bedroom, it was almost unnoticeable."
2,2018-10-08,The smell was okay but when it was shipped it must have been on it's side and in a hot truck because it was all melted on it's side and the wick was lost.  I had to put it on an electric burner to melt and pull up the wick.
2,2017-03-25,Yuck not for me too sweet
2,2017-09-04,Weak scent
2,2018-01-09,Eh
1,2017-05-08,I've had it lit now for an hour and no fragrance has come out it as of yet.It is a just a plain was candle.
1,2020-08-12,Second time in a row this jar was broken when I received it.Zero Stars.
1,2022-03-12,The candle had hardly any scent. And that's very unusual for a Yankee Candle.
1,2021-02-17,Bought this for my wife as a gift for Valentine’s Day. Opened the box the candle was completely melted/ disfigured. Wife loved the scent of the candle . Just very disappointed. The lid seemed melted.
3,2020-05-24,Came broken
1,2022-05-11,Jar was broken when received.fragance is very nice.
1,2021-03-23,I thought this would be lavender.
1,2022-01-04,On my first order the candle glass was shattered. I immediately ordered a replacement. My replacement was also chipped but I am able to use the candle. The scent is really nice...if you can get the candle in one piece.
3,2021-01-04,Not my type :(
1,2022-05-01,This is the one time I have received broken candle.
1,2021-04-21,Glass was broken ☹️
1,2021-02-24,Waste of money!  Yankee candles are not the same back then.  Quality sucks! Buy Village or Kringle instead for your money
1,2019-09-26,I ordered two of my favorite candle and they sent one that was completely shattered. There was broken glass leaking out of the box. I couldn't even take it out without cutting myself.  complete mess.
1,2014-03-08,"I was really upset that such an expensive item was packaged in bubble wrap only and not in its own small box.  I ordered another candle of the same size and a smaller item in the same order.  The other candle- Jasmine by Yankee also was bubble wrapped but packed in an individual box so it was in perfect condition.  My sister salvaged the candle but I was nerve wracked and had shards of glass pieces and splinters all over my floor.  It was very disappointing.  Now whenever I order candles I guess I have to order each one individually or risk getting one that's broken.  Amazon usually packages well.  I was shocked.  Now I have to look at this broken candle every day, which was supposed to look beautiful and peaceful."
3,2015-07-01,Smells good. The aroma isn't that strong. You will need to leave it burning for 20 min for full effect.
1,2019-07-29,"This just smells so, SO BAD. NOT like fresh cut roses in any way. Like horrible old lady rose scent. And it is so strong. Regret!"
4,2016-04-13,as described.
1,2021-11-23,Not useable.. 😪
2,2015-05-20,Since when did freshly cut roses smell like my grandmother's outdated perfume?
1,2020-12-12,The candles where melted when arrived junk
1,2022-04-03,Opened up box and top of candle was completely gone. Very disappointed. We order four candles a month and this has never happened
5,2016-05-12,Great
2,2015-05-18,Yankee candle is excellent but I paid double what ishou
1,2020-10-02,It was broken and just one and I almost cut myself
1,2020-09-09,This one is my favorite but this one has no smell!!!
1,2020-05-12,Very disappointed with the candle. Doesn’t have any smell. Will not recommend buying
1,2021-07-03,Very mild scent for a $30 candle. I usually get bath and body works but wanted to try something different. I will not be buying another yankee candle.
1,2018-10-19,"I can hear the  shattered glass pieces even before I open the package. I understand delivery people work so hard everyday, but maybe the should pay more attention on the  fragile  items."
1,2022-07-17,There was no wick so was so disappointed in the quality of this product. From now on will prefer to buy candles from store.
1,2017-07-17,"I agree with Amazon Customer on June 11th.  There is no smell of roses unless you get within a foot.  And then it is barely noticeable.  I have never bought Yankee Candles, and probably won't again.  Very disappointing"
1,2020-04-15,"I just received the Yankee candle & unfortunately the bottle was cracked. Was going to send back but with what's going on at this time with the virus, it's too much of a hassle !!! I do really like Yankee candles but disappointed it came this way. I will try to salvage as much of the candle as I can  😞"
1,2022-04-09,Smelled like something you’d get from a knock off.
1,2020-10-09,Both candles the glass was broken haven’t heard a thing about my complaint
1,2021-01-10,Candle smells absolutely awful don’t buy.
1,2020-07-28,I ordered two candles and both of them arrived in a very bad condition. One was melted and couldn't be used. The jar of the second one was broken and all over in the box.
1,2020-08-25,VERY DISAPPOINTED! I was waiting for days for this candle just for this to arrive?! 😭
1,2021-04-08,Doesn’t smell at alll
4,2016-07-24,"The person I bought it for loves these large candle jars.  They weren't real impressed with the scent, but love Yankee Candle."
1,2022-08-09,If I had known this before I bought it I never wasted my money it doesn't even smell there is no scent to this candle
1,2021-11-09,"Although i love yankee candles generally, they should really check their quality control.The candle arrived melted and unusuable at all. When asking for a refund i now have to go through the hassle of sending it back"
2,2021-02-01,No huele nada cuando la enciendes
1,2021-02-11,It arrived 4 days late and it was broken.  I  was very disappointed 😞I dislike the scent.  Sadly they are replacing it but I am forced to keep this same weak scent.  I even offered to take a candle that was cheaper but I was told no.
2,2015-08-11,This candle smells like leaves more than roses!
1,2022-05-14,USED & BROKEN!!!!!!
1,2021-06-21,This candle has no throw whatsoever. Do not buy.
1,2022-02-08,Product broken and candle melted.
1,2022-05-11,All 5 of my candles were like this. Tried to request a refund and order more and they wouldn’t allow it because it’s only a quality of 5
1,2020-07-22,It must have been badly mishandled to smash the glass as it's quite thick.
1,2021-08-15,This is my favorite candle scent. I’ve never had an issue with the scent until ordering off Amazon. Maybe I got a bad one but there was literally no scent of it
2,2018-04-09,Nice size candle. Long lasting. The only thing is that the scent is much sweeter than the one I get from the store. Didn’t like it as much. Much sweeter than I remember.
1,2018-01-29,I can’t even give this candle one star as it sucks. Once upon a time you could buy any Yankee Candle and bring it home to light and be blown away by the scent and scent throw. Yankee’s had your entire house smelling amazing. After Yankee candle was sold the new owners started cutting corners with the amount of scent they use in all their candles. I’ve spoken to Yankee Candle employees about this fact many times and they all seem to have a different excuse as to why Yankee’s don’t smell like they used to. My favorite one is that Yankee decided to lower the scent levels on most of its candles as people where complaining the scent was to strong and bothering them. If you believe this and don’t mind spending $25.00 plus dollars on a large Yankee candle that has zero to little smell then by all means go buy one. Unfortunatly Yanke Candle know only has roughly ten percent or less of all their candles that will fill your house with a fair to decent scent. Nothing amazing as in the past. Having to spend hundreds and hundreds at Yankee to find those few candles that smell good is ridicules. I can no longer recomend this company and its frankly sad as they were once so great
1,2021-01-16,"It smelled beautiful from outside the shipping box, which wasn’t a good sign. The first one came shattered. Reported to amazon and we had a second candle by the next day. That one was also shattered. Amazon doesn’t do a good job with shipping glass items apparently."
2,2014-07-30,I really don't like the scent of this candle.
1,2021-02-20,Just has lights inside small portion. Not good at all!
2,2020-04-16,Not much of a scent
1,2021-04-14,"Strong chemical-ish scent. I lit this candle for 5 minutes at home before blowing it out and putting it in my break room at work with a ‘free’ sign on it. That was weeks ago, and it’s still there."
5,2017-04-02,It's my FAVORITE scent.
1,2019-07-15,I am so mad right now. I just received my candle and it was horribly wrapped and broken into pieces! 😡
1,2020-11-06,"No scent throw,  very disappointed"
1,2018-04-09,Love this scent (White Gardenia) and ordered this candle and received Coconut Beach. And Coconut Beach had been burned before.
1,2020-08-05,"Came broken, returned"
1,2019-05-12,This candle has no odor when burned whatsoever it's supposed to give you a fragrance in your house but it does nothing
1,2020-07-19,Not would I would expect for a $30 candle :(
1,2021-09-03,"Candle durability is very less, Jar became black at the end. I am not sure is this an original product or not."
2,2013-06-28,"I carefully read the other reviews on this particular scent of candle, Sun & Sand, and it sounded delightful! After buying and lighting it up, it smells like, well, candle wax, even when I am right over the candle, nothing but a faint waft of an undefined candle smell. Even my husband asked me, is that candle supposed to smell like something?I am surprised at the other good reviews! I have had much better luck with some of the Slotkin candles, they really deliver!Try something else, you work hard for your money!"
1,2020-09-07,Arrived cracked
1,2020-09-08,no scent at all
1,2020-08-29,Arrived shattered in hundreds of small pieces. I was afraid to open the box. There was not enough padding or shipping product to prevent breakage.
2,2014-03-26,"Really pungent sweet florally scent, I suggest only buying these if you can smell them beforehand.  Second one I purchased that I did not like."
1,2020-05-01,This item came shattered in pieces
1,2022-02-03,The candle showed up melted and will not light.
1,2020-02-10,"did not like, wish I had bought a stronger scent."
1,2020-08-01,Product arrived broken.
1,2020-07-10,I received my order and 3 of the candles had melted and the wicks were embedded in them.  Useless.
1,2020-02-10,The candles I recieved were cracked and useless.
2,2018-02-18,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 It came without the label and I’m not sure why. Almost as if it was ripped off"
1,2019-06-07,There is no way that this is a yankee candle. My Walmart 5.00 candles smell stronger than this
1,2019-09-11,This is a fake Yankee Candle. I have been buying Yankee Candles for many years and I know them well. These are definitely NOT Yankee Candles. DO NOT BUY!!!
1,2020-03-12,The wax is not as strong as it used to be.
1,2020-12-27,Ordered this as a Christmas gift. I received it and there was no wick. I will be calling Yankee Candle tomorrow.
1,2022-07-12,"This candle was a disappointment, I burned it for 1 day, it never smelled like the beach, so I gave it away. Never again."
1,2021-05-17,Jar was broken when it arrived and the company will not reimburse me.
1,2022-07-17,I am glad that I did not end up giving this as a gift as it was not fragrant.
1,2021-05-05,Overpowering scent
1,2020-08-22,Came  damaged
4,2015-08-28,A great buy for me. Thank you very much. Hope to do business with you again.
1,2019-12-08,"I bought the candle because I have the car sent. The candle is beautiful, but just burns nothing!!! You get no smell out of it!!!"
1,2020-08-02,"Smeels like my new bride's underwear, who's 70 BTW"
1,2021-08-23,Should have read fine print but for price I did not expect to get a barbi size candle. Should last us a few days. Geez.
1,2020-07-18,Can’t even use it came melted
1,2022-01-23,I ordered twice both times broken.  Avoid.
3,2016-01-09,Strong perfume scent.  Too much for me.
1,2020-01-05,Doesn't scent like other I've purchase
1,2021-04-06,The candle was heat damaged.  I had to melt in boiling water and reset the wick
1,2020-08-21,My candles came and we not usable it is obvious the wax inside the candles melted into there lids
1,2022-08-13,No smell. Worst ever
3,2016-09-21,Doesn't have a very strong aroma.
1,2021-01-20,"The candles were marked as Lilac Blossom on the outside of each candle box, however all 4 candles were Pink Sands scent.  I am very disappointed because I wanted the Lilac Blossom candles for a dinner party I am having tonight."
1,2020-07-28,I just don’t understand how this keeps happening
2,2020-05-04,"Of the three, one of the Yankee Candle jars was broken."
1,2022-04-07,"Dissatisfied with the brand. No scent, no durability. It was like a sample of candle-light, nothing else."
1,2021-08-13,Bought 2 candles it was delivered but the box was beat up one of the candle jars was shattered when I opened  the box I had glass all over the floor . Am not happy about this !
3,2016-09-06,Came broken.
2,2012-10-08,this candle has a very strong wax in the air.  it smell good though.  if you have a big room like maybe 20x20 it might be ok.  but my room was 13x12 and it was overpowering with the smell of wax.
1,2022-01-04,My candle arrived broke .. I think someone has it out of for me just my luck
1,2020-07-10,Arrived shattered in box.
1,2019-02-21,This candle is only good for holding a lit wick. It has zero smell. Thinking it was a Yankee Candle Product I thought it would have some benefit. Maybe if I lose my power I may have use for it.
1,2022-03-08,Candle jar was shattered but box was undamaged! Disappointed for sure
1,2020-10-23,waste of time since i couldnt use it and have to take it back now
1,2021-09-04,The seller should have stated this is a 4oz candle. It should be half the price.
1,2021-01-03,Wrong candles😈
1,2021-04-06,No fragrance
1,2020-08-15,Candle was broke
1,2020-12-14,"The candle arrived with glass all over the inside box and the outside box. You could hear the glass as soon as you picked up the package. It smells good, but it can't be used."
3,2015-02-06,Scent is not as strong as others.
1,2021-10-08,Candle was melted to the side so you couldn't light it
1,2020-07-16,Poor product
1,2017-06-30,twice i have ordered yankee candle large lilac blossoms. both times the glass was completely shattered. I will not try to order again...
1,2015-07-30,"Candle came with decorative sticker all messed up. Looked like it had been stuck, peeled off and reapplied. Also candle must have melted in delivery and was not even and looks like it was used. Wanted to give it with a wedding gift and it won't be possible to do so."
2,2019-06-22,I didn’t like it
1,2021-11-23,These candles arrived melted and unusable. Not worth the price and not worthy of gifting.
1,2022-04-29,Do not buy the candles from this company they SUCK!!!!!!
3,2017-05-08,"I love Yankee candles this smells like soap to me. I thought I would go with more of the spring smells.  I adore the warmer smells.  Apple pie, Carmel etc. This was a test drive for me. If you like the smell of soap this is for you."
1,2022-01-03,"I was very disappointed with this candle.  It does not smell like the beach, in fact, it smells like a plain candle burning."
1,2018-11-30,Item arrived totally smashed.  No gluing this. I want another shipped
1,2017-08-29,"I love Yankee Candles, but this is one I can not have in my home. The overwhelming smell of this candle lite or not caused a migraine to set it."
1,2022-01-21,Could barely smell the scent when lit
2,2014-04-24,This candle did  arrive on time but really was not what I expected.To me it did  not seem to do any better than a candle that cost $5.00 dollars.I am sorry I bought it but I learned a big lesson on the information I thought was right.
1,2021-11-28,"After being lit for 15 minutes, still no scent."
1,2020-01-05,Cent is just not there
2,2017-07-28,"Has a very sweet undertone. Was hoping for something more beachy, fresh & light smelling. To me the scent is a little heavy. However, If you like vanilla, you should like this candle."
2,2016-04-26,"I like the physical design of the candle, looks really high quality. Although it smells nothing like jasmine in my opinion. I don't know why I was expecting something like Jasmine Green tea. This smells more like Clorox than Jasmine. I was seriously so sad. I even ordered some extra stuff off amazon to get same day shipping. Turns out it was a garbage scent."
1,2019-04-16,As soon as I grabbed the box I could hear the shattered glass inside.  I was very disappointed when I opened the box and found my candle broken. :((I am a big fan of yankee candle and this is the first one I have ever got in pieces. Please do something about this!!
1,2020-08-22,I heard noises inside which was unusual since this is a candle...there should not be clinking noises. The candle was in an amazon box with two “airplus” bags. Pretty disappointed as it was supposed to be a gift for someone.
1,2020-05-02,I ordered a candle because it’s a specific scent that’s hard to find. When it arrived it looked like it had melted and rehardened and now i can’t burn it. It still smells good but what a waste ☹️
4,2014-12-09,As advertised.
2,2017-08-26,NO FRAGRANCE AT ALL . EXPECTED MORE FROM THE NAME AND THE PRICE
1,2019-01-26,I hate the smell. it's like cookies. not in a good way.
1,2019-10-19,No smell..... What a wast of money
4,2015-01-20,good!
1,2019-02-07,Not a real Yankee candle barely smell that all.
1,2020-07-17,"LOVE Yankee Candles, Lilac Blossoms is one of my favorites.  Unfortunately, both the original order and the replacement order arrived shattered.  Broken glass EVERYWHERE.  Packaging is horrible. Won't order via Amazon again."
1,2021-07-10,The candle was melted when I received it.  It was in such a bad condition that I couldn’t even find the wick to light it.  It was trash.
1,2020-04-11,This candle didnt smell at all and burned fast .
3,2018-06-01,I got it in the mail and the glass was all broke. :(
1,2021-12-30,Horrible scent
1,2022-08-06,It’s melted sideways. Unusable.
1,2020-05-29,It came home melted...
1,2018-07-05,"Must be reject Yankee Candles , did not last long and no significant smell"
1,2018-03-19,Product/glass  arrived broken. There was no fragile sign on box.
1,2022-04-19,RECEVIED THIS YANKEE CANDLE NO WICK INCLUDED THIS IS A RIP OFF BUYER BEWARE
1,2020-02-17,Smelled like a old church
1,2017-12-07,"I'm quite disappointed. This is one of my favorite flowers and I love the smell of it, but the candle has literally no fragrance. So please don't waste your money!"
1,2022-04-30,There was no wick in my candle! Wish I could light it
1,2018-09-09,The candle  has zero throw. Also the burn is very irregular.
1,2021-03-11,"Smells like soap, I don't even want to light it."
1,2020-08-08,"I usually love Yankee candles, but this one arrived broken. It was going to be a gift, but it was broken."
1,2019-01-11,"I truly love the aroma of the gardenia. When I received this prize and smelled the cap, yum. When I lit the candle, all I smelled was wax. As I let the candle burn... there was never a hint of fragance. Bummer!"
1,2021-12-24,"It was shattered to pieces.Very disappointed, since this is a gift."
1,2020-04-16,Arrived broken
1,2020-07-19,"The lilac scent is amazing, and they last a long time, but have seriously dropped the ball in breaking our candles in delivery. Twice in a row broken ones sent. If they could be sent in one piece, they’d be great."
1,2018-03-10,"Very , very weak fragrance . I am disappointed because all other Yankee products have been great."
1,2020-08-27,This candle does not smell like it’s descriptors support. It actually stinks. But would like if you enjoy the scent of laundry detergent.
1,2022-01-13,No smell at all. I will not buy again
1,2020-12-25,Candle was completely melted into the lid and covered the wick. Not usable.
1,2021-01-07,"Unlike any other yankee candle I’ve ever had had, this one has no scent and the blue color when burned at the top looks yellowish. Very disappointed 😢"
1,2020-06-03,I never had an issue with a yankee candle filling a room with a pleasant smell.. until this one I purchased from Amazon. Incredibly disappointed that this candle does not have much of a scent at all.
1,2021-03-01,Horrible. Not Lavender.
1,2020-06-04,No smell At All
1,2021-09-19,
1,2021-09-20,I never ordered this
3,2014-05-04,"Too expensive. Try yankeecandle.com for a better price. The smell is spot on though. Good candle, bad price. Lol lol"
3,2014-05-24,"It's okay. the scent is beautiful; all I need to do is take the lid off and it refreshes the room. it will last and last because when I do burn it, it only needs to burn for a short time to freshen up the room. I give it 3 stars because it is not my favorite of the Yankee Candle scents, but still a good purchase."
1,2019-04-18,Hardly any scent.
1,2021-09-29,Very upset about this situation.Smells delicious but I can't use it.👎👎👎
1,2022-01-18,Smell was great but could not use candle did not have a wick to burn
2,2016-08-16,"Smells very nice ,but it arrived with broken jar. Packaging did not have any protection, just a box with broken glass and wax."
1,2021-12-26,Candle jar broken upon arrivel.
1,2020-02-12,"This is the most non smelling candle I have ever had.  The only time I can smell it, is when I blow it out."
1,2020-10-09,"Third time getting a replacement shipped, and third time I’ve received a shattered candle."
1,2020-05-12,"The glass jar my candle was in was shattered! The box wasn’t damaged but the candle sure was! This is my first bad review from an order but when I say the glass was shattered, I mean in a million pieces!"
1,2020-03-28,"I was disappointed when this candle arrived and the rim of the jar was broken as if there was a bite taken out of it.  Jar lid not able to attach, another household member lit it anyway, so I could not return it."
2,2016-04-25,"Reasonable price, however, there is absolutely no scent! Would not buy again."
1,2020-08-30,"I should have read the reviews. I just assumed, all Yankee candles are the same. Over $50 later, I bought two. I’m very very disappointed. No sent at all. These are old candles."
1,2017-01-27,"Very faint smell of roses.  , After trimming the wick to 1/8"", I lit it and it burned and smell did not intensify.  Very disappointed.  Would not order again."
4,2017-11-28,Smells nice!
1,2021-03-02,"It burns alright, but it doesn’t smell like a yankee candle should"
1,2020-07-29,I love Yankee candles but will never buy again from Amazon second candle out of three came in broken insufficient packaging
1,2021-03-21,"Sadly, it arrived broken."
1,2022-08-01,Came in melted and not useable
1,2021-01-11,I did not like the scent of this candle
1,2021-05-20,The candle glass arrived broken 😞
1,2016-08-08,"I buy Yankee Scented Candles all the time and the fragrance is always good..  However, this one  'Summer Wish'  barely has a scent  --  You need to stick your head in the jar to smell anything..  I only gave it 1 * because the site does not allow NO STAR rating, which is how it should be rated..  Yankee Candles are not cheap, so for them to sell the no scent candle is shameful.. I am going to file a complaint and wait to see what comes of it..  DO NOT BUY ""SUMMER WISH"" !!  I never thought to read the reviews because I never had this problem with a Yankee Candle in the past.."
1,2022-03-21,The candle broke shortly after I started burning it
1,2022-08-08,It was broken when delivered
1,2020-07-15,Came broken into pieces and wanted me to ship back to receive replacement. Unacceptable. 2nd candle to come broken.
1,2022-05-03,Did not smell beachy was disappointed!
1,2020-05-03,Has almost no smell.
1,2022-04-11,Item needs replacing since it arrived damaged.
1,2021-12-02,Small tumbler too small for price
1,2019-09-13,The candle glass was shattered when it was delivered. I am returning it
1,2017-03-07,No fragrance! Very disappointing. Will be returning both candles. Buyer beware.
1,2022-06-05,The glass jar was broken
1,2016-02-29,Really bummed that it arrived broken. It smells great but how will I continue to light it?
1,2019-07-03,Arrived with glass broken. I received a credit but will not purchase a glass candle online again.
2,2013-09-29,Yankee Candles are amazing but DO NOT order from here!!The packaging is not sturdy enough and it will not come in one piece.I'm so upset I paid this much and I cant even put the cap on the candle because the sides are broken into pieces. I tried to glue it the best I could but the wax will drip down once it gets to the level where it was shattered. SOO disappointed...I advise you to go to the actual store or order it from there website.
1,2022-01-07,The candle was melted to one side. Not a good Christmas gift..
1,2021-03-12,Scent reminded me of funeral home old floweres
4,2017-03-06,I gave it as a gift
1,2020-02-03,There was no to little scent to this candle.
1,2017-12-07,Please don't waste your money buying this. This has no smell literally. I'm so disappointed!
1,2020-08-21,"I have always had a great experience with these candles for my home but, the last two times they have come broken. This time it was beyond fix."
1,2018-12-29,I was very very disappointed because it smelled like a cheap wax candle.  I’ve used Yankee Candles for years and typically have to blow them out after a half hour or so because they get too strong.  I’m certain it was defective and turned out to be a bad gift idea.
1,2018-08-26,Candle has no fragrance/scent.
1,2017-11-29,When I got my candle someone had put the lid on incorrectly and it was shattered when I opened it. When I say incorrectly I mean that the top glass part of the lid was jammed into the glass instead of the softer plastic that fits snuggly. This is the first time I’ve had a bad experience with an amazon delivery.
1,2020-09-29,Product was shattered- both the lid and the jar containing the candle. This candle was packed in a larger individual box than the other 2.
1,2018-01-18,Fool me once... shame on youFool me twice...shame on me
1,2021-09-16,"Smells great, but arrived in the mail like this and is not usable. Ridiculous"
1,2021-12-08,The product was broken when delivered.
1,2020-07-24,My item came broken and I don’t want to waste time returning a broken item. This is not the first time I have issues with you. Can my item be replaced. Thanks
1,2016-02-02,Absolutely no scent. I ordered three Yankee candles and as I lit and burned all three there was absolutely no scent. I even asked a friend that came by and she agreed. I attribute it to maybe old candles?
1,2021-02-25,This is the tinies candle. Paid $20+ and thought it was a large candle but that’s not the case.
3,2012-05-30,"I thought that the smell would be stronger. Still a good candle, but not a 'housewarmer' as it is called."
1,2020-04-02,Wrong fragrance
2,2018-01-25,needs more sent
1,2020-11-22,"Candle arrived in melted condition, leaked out into box and separated from side of jar. Unable to use!"
1,2017-02-04,Why should 5I have to go out of my way to return a broken glass candle that was quite expensive?
1,2019-04-26,This is the most defective candle I have ever bought. I have always been a fan of yankee until now. I cant keep the candle lit. It sizzles like there is water in it
1,2022-03-02,Damaged.
1,2020-02-18,If you are looking for a Yankee Candle that throws great scent --this is NOT the one. I can't even smell it when it is directly in front of me. No scent whatsovever.
1,2021-02-05,Love this scent but uhhh I just received this candle and it is shattered!!😭
1,2020-07-12,"My lilac candle was delivered broken glass all inside box, i would like another one unbroken please, have not recieved any word back"
2,2018-02-16,First one came broken just thrown in boxHad to get replacement
1,2020-05-04,Love the smell of the candle but when I received it in the mail it seemed to have melted. There was pool up in the top lid and was not able to find the wick. So disappointing
1,2020-05-10,This candle came with the glass broken! I am very mad!!!!! It was a gift and it is disappointing that it was broken when they opened it.
1,2016-08-06,don't bother has no smell to it.  very disappointing
1,2020-07-10,Someone forgot to add the scent.
1,2017-01-31,The candle was received with the label messed up.  I returned it.
4,2018-02-13,Nice candle.
1,2019-06-08,"The candle most be old , I can barely smell it and it’s been burning for two hours."
1,2021-10-29,So 2 out of 3 came this way. 🤷🏼‍♀️
3,2014-12-30,Love Yankee candles but they have a lot of toxic fumes and smoke like crazy.
1,2020-04-30,I love this scent but the candle itself arrived shattered. The box literally had glass shards falling out of it before i even opened it up.
2,2017-11-25,"Yankee candles I have purchased in the past, I could smell the scent as soon as I open the box.But this one' scent is so faint, I have to stick my nose deep into the jar to get some whiff of lilac.Also there are many white spots on top of the candle which looks like fungus. Close examination tells they are not fungus, and I don't know what they are.Maybe this candle has been sitting in a warehouse for many years, hence the lack of scent and the weird white things on top."
1,2018-05-23,it does not produce any smell.
1,2020-07-24,"Have always loved this scent, however, ordered it the first time and it came shattered. Ordered a replacement and that one came the same way."
1,2021-12-22,I received the candle broken glass.
1,2017-07-26,NO scent.
1,2019-10-30,"As much as I love Yankee Candles they are no good if the packaging has them end up in pieces. It is hazard to handle the broken glass, so this is going in the garbage...Very disappointed : ("
1,2020-08-24,"Wrong advertisement: I received PINK SANDS fragrance not Lilac blossom. Nothing against Pink Sands, but that’s not what I ordered."
2,2017-05-08,I never spent this much on a candle but thought I would give it a try to hopefully to add a fragrance to my room. After 5 minutes of burning there was no scent coming from it and I was only 3 feet away from it
1,2018-01-24,Arrived broken.
1,2021-11-08,
1,2016-09-24,"It smelled fine, but the glass container is shattered to bit!"
1,2020-07-10,Won’t buy again
1,2021-01-09,I love the scent. But it doesn’t last as long as advertised. Not worth price
1,2020-05-22,My item arrived broken and shattered.
1,2019-07-19,Didn’t burn like a Yankee candle?
2,2015-12-16,I had to return this item because the wick was not long enough to light the candle! The fragrance was ok. I would not choose this one again. Very disappointed.
1,2020-09-23,"too soft, almost imperceptible"
1,2018-10-21,Broken replace the 2 or credit my acct for 2
1,2020-02-10,Yankee Candles don't smell up the room like they used to!  Very disappointed and won't be purchasing them again!
1,2021-05-03,This was like burning wax without a scent.
2,2015-09-12,For those days when you want your house to smell like a funeral home.
1,2021-02-28,Box of broken glass with a very pleasant aroma
1,2019-03-31,Want refund
1,2018-05-12,"Not very strong scent.  Do not smell when walk in room, etc."
1,2020-10-29,Product came broken in the package and glass was everywhere. Essentially unusable at this point.
2,2016-07-13,"I love this smell; however, when it came in the mail, it was on its side. This resulted in the wax pooling to one side of the container. I had to leave it in the sun all day to even it out."
1,2020-05-31,My mom received a bag of zip ties!!!!! Not the candle!!
1,2018-03-07,Came broken
1,2018-10-26,"Thus was a real waste of money can not smell nothing, These candles  suck never buy then again."
1,2019-04-27,Arrived damaged
1,2021-10-07,Sent seperates from wax .
1,2020-05-13,My candle was not handed with care it come broken not happy with this payed $20 and don’t know if I use it
1,2019-09-22,Smells like a nursing home :(
1,2020-06-04,"I ordered the ""Fresh Cut Roses"" and received ""White Gardenia"" instead.."
1,2018-04-16,It burned Very strange. A 2 inch in circumference tree down in the middle and then I had to scrape the size just to get the candle to burn correctly there is something wrong with the batch of candles that I received
1,2019-08-28,No wick even to lite the candle. I must say that I’m deeply disappointed and shocked by how this could happen.
1,2019-02-06,Too strong small doesn’t seem like it’s from yankiCandle
1,2015-04-29,"If I could, I would give this 0 stars. Unbelievably bad packaging. Holder came SHATTERED. I tried to use the candle anyway but it burned completely unevenly without the holder surrounding in. Complete waste of money."
1,2021-03-02,DO NOT BUY. HAS NO SCENT.
1,2020-05-08,"It smells great of course. Thing is, it's all melted and spilling out the lid. There also isn't a wick so I can't even use this."
1,2020-12-14,Ordered 4 2 of them were broken
1,2017-02-03,These candles are not the real deal. They are not nearly as fragrant as the real yankee candles. I was highly disappointed.
1,2020-08-08,Love this scent. Have ordered before. But this time candle was melted and wax is over wick
1,2020-05-07,In the description they stated that it was a six pack. I only received 1. I want the other 5.
1,2020-02-06,Well mine came in the mail broken so that’s neat!

1,2016-06-22,The label is not the same as Yankee candle retailer. Possibly fraudulent.
1,2019-11-26,Hardly a scent to this candle.  Very disappointed
1,2020-07-21,2 out of 3 candles were smashed. Packaging was good but glass on candles were broke.
1,2019-04-29,Arrived with broken glass even with box and jar cover.  Afraid to light candle since jar is cracked at the top and looks to continue cracking with wear.
2,2016-04-29,Not as posted described. I wanted black coconut and received Yankee candle black island Palm ? Never saw such a scent from Yankee..
2,2013-04-02,"Do not at all like the smell, it is a wedding gift, hope they like the strong scent of roses"
1,2020-07-19,Was busted to Pieces when I opened the box.

1,2020-05-20,It was broken when I received it im so upset about it
1,2018-04-04,Nice large candle but you can hardly smell it. I almost question whether they slapped a yankee candle sticker on some knock off candle.
1,2021-02-07,My candle arrived broken.
1,2016-03-28,I don't know why I keep being asked to review this product.  It arrived smashed beyond use.
2,2017-08-09,"Love Yankee candles, but very disappointed in this one.  Smells great in the jar, but gives off almost NO scent when burning."
1,2020-02-18,Scent lacked

1,2020-01-19,It came broken in a million pieces.
1,2019-04-06,Yankee Candle came damaged. I'll just go to the store instead for candles from now on.
1,2018-03-27,"I ordered “Sun & Sand, Large Tumbler, 2 wick” and received... “Mountain Lodge, Large Jar, 1 wick”! Really?!"
1,2018-10-28,The candle arrived broken
1,2020-07-10,A broken candle is just not useful. This is the 2nd one.
1,2013-08-29,"Not packed well enough, I fear.  It was wrapped in bubble wrap, but it needs to have several layers around it.  As for the scent, I've used it for some time and it smells exactly like a huge lilac bush.  Scents a whole room easily."
1,2020-05-16,"I did not receive this item, it was a dog grooming set"
1,2019-12-27,Doesn’t have a very strong scent.
1,2020-05-06,Couldn't even open the box because glass shards were everywhere
1,2018-12-11,This candle doesn’t have scent.Don’t buy. It’s a waste of money
1,2016-03-16,"Smells amazing , bad packaging , the jar arrived cracked with broken pieces"
1,2019-12-14,The wick died after the first use and still cannot get it to light so that was a waste
1,2018-12-13,broken
1,2020-05-28,Keep receiving candles that are shattered in pieces.
1,2020-08-08,The container was broke
1,2020-05-04,Candle arrived with the glass jar broken.
1,2020-04-11,Received broken
1,2018-02-18,"No scent at all. So disappointed since this is one of my favorite smells. Sending all 3 of them back. Been buying these for 20 years, where did the quality control go? I guess YC has decided that their profit margin is more important than their loyal customer base. Caveat emptor!"
1,2020-05-17,Candle came all messed up
1,2020-08-20,Received damaged one twice
1,2018-09-25,ordered multiple times...came shattered every time.
1,2020-05-03,it came totally broken and too late
1,2017-11-29,Arrived broken so unfortunately won’t even be able to light.
1,2020-04-09,candle was  totally damaged glass was in pieces
1,2019-12-31,This candle came in pieces. Glass was shattered.
1,2020-04-22,Candle was broken upon arrival.
1,2018-07-19,No scent unless you hold your nose up to it
1,2019-01-21,Just got my candle delivered and it was broken.
1,2016-09-21,I don't know if this is fake Yankee...it has a really bad black smoke.
1,2017-05-11,Very disappointed. After having the candle lit for over three hours we could not smell anything. Even put my nose up to the candle and could barely smell the fragrance . I will not buy this candle again and I love Yankee candles
1,2014-01-14,I got a refund but it really was packaged horribly. No surprise it broke. It's a bummer because I really wanted to take a chance on Yankee Candle. I guess I should have kept my loyalty with Bath and Body Works.
1,2016-11-13,My candle came melted and the wick was completely inside the wax. I was unable to use the candle at all. Would like a refund or sent a new candle.
1,2017-05-03,I don't smell much scent and it doesn't really smell like jasmine
1,2017-12-25,Candle had melted was lying on side. Could t get to wick to light it
1,2017-09-21,"When I received the package, I found the candle had melted and leaked through the cap. I had to throw it away. The Jasmine candle, however, was fine."
1,2016-02-02,Absolutely no scent! Perhaps because it's so old? Very disappointed...
1,2013-04-21,"If I could have given this candle negative. stars I eagerly would have. The scent it produced was barely noticeable from a foot away. I don't think I should have to risk singeing. my nose to earn the tiniest whiff of gardenia. A candle of that size AND price should be capable of filling much of room with the delightful fragrance of gardenia. It might as well have been either unlit or in a different home-miles away.  For the price it was a gigantic disappointment. Even it it had been free,  it would not have been a bargain.  I feel cheated, ripped off and not a little angry. Fellow gardenia lovers,  avoid this product by all means and save yourselves. cost, disappointment,  and anger."
1,2018-06-15,Did not really smell strong enough for the room.
1,2018-05-04,My candle arrived melted. So I am unable to light it; the wick is covered up.
1,2018-11-13,But can came in with glass half smashed.... unusable
1,2018-12-21,Absolutely upset that my candle arrived completely shattered
1,2016-09-09,Came melted. Heating in water on low can help save it.
1,2016-02-04,The candle arrived completely shattered. Very disappointing.
1,2018-12-19,Terrible no scent
1,2018-01-06,"Just doesn’t have the aroma that most yankee candles have, old or seconds."
1,2016-05-02,"Arrived broken. I reported it, and was asked to return it. I did not feel comfortable returning broken glass. So i was not reimbursed, but i love these candles, so i cant threaten that i wont buy more candles at price point. You all asked for the review, but if it happens again i will be calling."
1,2017-10-05,Doesn’t not produce a noticeable scent. Waste of money. Disappointed.
1,2016-08-29,Fake product. The label was missing from the jar and the scent was not the same as one I purchased at the store.
2,2015-06-09,"Was very disappointed, the candle didn't burn all the way down like most of my Yankee candles do. next time I'll buy it from the actual company instead of Amazon"
1,2015-04-07,scent throw not good
1,2018-09-07,"I am a avid user of Yankee Candles and I have never been disappointed with a fragrance until I bought this Lilac fragrance. I have had many before that actually smelled like Lilacs, but this smells awful!  It is definitely not the sweet and lovely fragrance of Lilacs. I am so disappointed and will probably chuck it in the garbage."
1,2017-12-17,"High priced crappy candle, will not buy again"
1,2019-01-30,So disappointing
1,2019-08-22,Received broken
1,2018-08-05,Don't waste your money.
1,2016-04-08,I received my candle today and it was shattered
1,2018-03-07,the candle arrived without a label :/
2,2016-10-04,Too much lilac
1,2017-10-21,Ordered a pink sands large 2-Wick and got sent a strawberry lemon ice double wick  great 😂
1,2018-10-09,This product was broken in thousand's of pieces
2,2017-01-14,Box was labeled correctly but once opened it was French vanilla.  It was a Christmas gift.
2,2015-07-06,I've decided that these candles are ridiculously priced and don't even smell very much. I did NOT receive the pictured candle. I received one with a silver flat top and two wicks. Ridiculous Pricing Point.
1,2014-01-16,My wife gave it wrapped to her sister and when she opened it the wax was deformed and no wick was found.
1,2014-05-05,"My candle was wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap, and in a box with a couple other items with room to move around.  The glass is all shattered inside the bubble wrap and now I have to return it.  Big disappointment."
1,2016-07-16,"The fragrance is thick and cheap, clearly doesn't feel like natural roses. Sometimes I feel nauseated by it. And I am stuck with it because how do you return a candle."
1,2016-09-07,"The candles were melted, it was upsetting because they were a gift."
2,2014-02-25,"When I had used it for couple of hours, I found a black smog from it. OMGThere are a lot of other candles which are cheaper and better in qualities."
1,2017-01-05,"Received broken. It smelled nice, but the candle is useless to me.  I also am not able to print a return label. Never had a problem like that before."
1,2017-12-03,
1,2016-09-13,Arrived broken. I didn't want to ship glass back.
1,2017-08-03,"I ordered this, the black coconut candle.  I received ""pink hibiscus"" instead. Returning. If I order again will I receive the correct candle?"
1,2017-03-14,it do not last long for the price they selling it for and it do not smell where you can tell it burning I will never buy another  Yankee Candle
5,2013-01-30,So I guess I blacked out again.  I was at a friends house and while I was wasted I tried to light my cig with thier Yankee Candle.  I lit my cig but what I was not aware of was the hot wax from the candle was running  down my chest...did I mention I was naked wearing her grandma's robe? After waking up the next morning in a horse stall with nothing on but an Indian head dress I decided to replace the candle I had ruined.  They love it!
1,2016-12-05,"Yes this was the candle I wanted, the size, scent and price were great. BUT I can't enjoy it because it was delivered to me completely broken. This was supposed to be a gift for my mother and I wanted to surprise her with this scent and now just to get my money back I have to ship this broken glass back?"
1,2017-09-23,I have never paid this much for a candle but wanted to see if the brand lived up to it's reputation. Very disapointed. no smell my dollar store brand had a better value.
1,2015-04-16,No smell of Jasmine.
1,2012-06-08,Candle was packaged well but the wax had melted and the wick is useless. Disappointing to pay that much for a candle and not be able to burn it. I do have a candle warmer so I can enjoy the fragrance but not the ambience of the candle flame.
1,2017-02-07,Came smashed in the mail.
1,2016-02-14,No scent.
1,2013-12-14,i ordereed 3 22 ounce jars and i only got two of the right scent and i got no invoice slip soooooo now I'm stuck with the wrong NOT matching scents :(
1,2014-04-12,"Jar broke, the packaging was not good. Was not able to use the candle . Had to throw it away."
1,2016-04-04,Omg I love these candles but this is the worst fragrance. It gave me such a blinding head ache.
1,2016-05-29,Product was shattered upon arrival.
1,2015-07-02,no smell at all
1,2015-12-06,Candle came broken.
2,2014-10-05,"Smells like a hospital, or cleaning products. Not gardenia-y at all. Very disappointing. Only time I've been disappointed by a Yankee candle in my life."
2,2018-01-13,"I ordered several of these candles in August.  I was too busy caring for my terminally ill father and put the unopened box on a shelf.  I opened the box to  wrap the candles as Christmas gifts and discovered they were Medium instead of the Large size!  It is really upsetting, but, I guess it's my fault for not inspecting."
1,2016-08-18,No smell......candle old???????
1,2016-09-09,no fragrance at all!
1,2017-10-30,I didnt smell anything and they pooped eveytime I tried to light them. I do not belive that these candles are authentic.
1,2013-09-21,"I am using candle warmer for those candles. The smell is very faint, and lasted probably for the less then third of this candle. I feel like I wasted my money"
1,2014-05-09,"This candle doesn't spell like anything at all.  Was really hoping for a string coconut scent, but if put a blindfold on me and put this candle in front of me I'd have to guess I was smelling an unscented candle."
1,2017-07-28,Wax melted side way inside of the glass container. Now the wick is completely covered. What kind of a nonsense is this?!
2,2015-03-03,"Good Quality candle, but I do not like the smell"
2,2015-06-01,The candle was great - but it arrived to me broken with glass everywhere!
1,2014-04-05,"The candle came to me sounding like a maraca.  There was way too much room in the box and the protective wrapping did not work, so the glass broke.  A rare fail for Amazon, and I've been a good customer for quite a while."
1,2012-11-05,"I ordered two.  Both arrived having clearly been stored on their side in a warm environment.  Wax filled the glass jar lid, thus the wick was no where to be seen.I sent a kind note to Yankee Candle advising them of their issue.  Their response was totally unhelpful and without empathy.On principle, I will not purchase another product from this company."
1,2013-09-17,Arrived shattered all over the box!! Would be more costly to send it back and don't want to chance replacing it for getting another one that is broken. Will not order again.
1,2014-01-17,I have been burning my candle now for 12 hrs. It has no scent! Very disappointed! I paid 28$ for it!
1,2014-03-19,I could tell it was an old candle because the scent was almost nonexistent the first time I smelled it.  Too much to pay for an old candle.
1,2015-06-23,the glass was shattered!
1,2018-01-18,Not the same scent as the one I bought directly from Yankee candle last year.
1,2015-09-14,This candle is so strong and overpowering. And it isn't in a good way. I can definitely smell the musk. I would not recommend this candle to ANYONE.
1,2017-11-13,"I ordered two of these.  One was fine but the other had melted, coming out of the glass candle holder in a way that made it impossible to even see or find the wick.  I was extremely disappointed as I love Yankee Candles.  Guess I should have mailed it back but i had thrown the box away and the candle was unusable.  I hope I'm not seeing a pattern here with Amazon or Yankee Candles.  Also, one of the green Cedar and Balsam candles had somehow melted a little outside of the jar and stained my genuine Vermont Country Store oilcloth table cloth.  Yuk.  I hope you will work on improving this, Amazon.  Thanks for listening."
1,2015-11-28,"DO NOT BUY THIS ! This one has already broken ,and can't use !!! Waste the money !!!"
1,2016-09-09,Came melted. Had to slow heat in water to save it
1,2014-10-08,"This arrived in 10,000 pieces. I will not even open the box because it will likely explode shards of glass all over me and my house. Really, really not okay with how this was handled. It's going back in the thousand pieces it came in with extra tape to ensure the shards don't poke through the box."
1,2015-10-15,glass was broken when i opened the box
1,2015-06-09,The candle was shattered when I received it.
1,2016-11-15,I ordered the pink sands candle and received the French vanilla candle. Still smells good but not what I ordered.
1,2016-09-02,"Was incorrect scent... I received black cherry, not pink sands. I would return, but I needed this candle for a gift I am giving in 2 days."
1,2014-09-19,IT WAS BROKEN
1,2015-06-23,Was broken when it arrived!
5,2018-03-03,"I really enjoy the special atmosphere that burning candles create, and so my family goes through a lot of them.  In trying different brands, we've found that Yankee Candles can be counted on for good burn time and consistency--it's so frustrating to have a candle that's only half burned but for whatever reason the wicks suddenly refuse to stay lit. It's also frustrating to have a candle that smells nice up close out of the box, but the smell is faint or nonexistent with burning.  These things don't happen with the Yankee Candle brand.This particular candle is their large jar size, with an estimated 110-150 hours burning time. This is the first Yankee Candle I've ordered online, as opposed to buying from a store, and I will say that I was highly impressed with the packaging.  There was a separate Yankee Candle cardboard shipping box placed inside an amazon box, and the candle itself was nestled securely in a molded/corrugated paper/cardboard device...I'm doing a terrible job describing it, so see the attached photo.  In sum, there's virtually no chance of breakage or damage to the glass container while shipping.I was curious to try this candle because it is a new scent for the Yankee Candle line, called ""A calm and quiet place,"" an intriguing and appealing name if I ever heard.  The product description calls it a ""meditative fragrance,"" built of ""gentle jasmine, a whisper of patchouli, and warm amber musk.""  Many of our favorite candles have been heavily patchouli-centric, so I was eager to try this new scent.  The verdict?  I liked it, and my husband liked it, a lot.  I'm not sure I detected the jasmine--both my husband and I felt that ""vanilla"" predominated, even though vanilla is not listed as one of the prime ingredients.  There was indeed a slight hint (but not overly strong presence) of patchouli, and the ""warm amber musk"" was an apt description.  Buying a scented product on the basis of verbal descriptions over the internet is always a risky prospect, but I can vouch that the ""calm and quiet place"" scent is not overpowering and is very pleasant, and if you like the sounds of vanilla/patchouli/warm musk, I think you would like this candle.  You'll find cheaper candles at your local drugstore, but I have found that with candles there's a real benefit to paying more for a quality brand.  I'm happy to recommend this candle highly."
1,2016-05-28,"Terrible!!!!!These candles were awful, I have had better experience with cheap ones from Walmart by far. I lit it the first time and left the room for a while, when I came back not only did it not smell like the scent but it smelled like pure candle wax. I swear I felt like I was walking in a funeral home or church. I bought two candles and I lit them at the same time in two different rooms, the same for both. Just terrible, there was nothing pleasant with these smells. I would love to ship them back even without a refund just to get the insult out of my house. I spent over $30 dollars on plain candle wax smell!!!!NEVER AGAIN!!!Buy at your own risk!"
1,2014-09-21,Love this scent!  Probably my favorite.
5,2020-10-10,My husband bought this candle as a surprise anniversary gift and it was perfect. I don't know how Yankee Candles do it but the smell of this candle brought me back to our wedding day like it had just happened 5 minutes ago.The scent is slightly floral with hints of sweet musk and earthy notes of sandalwood. The candle is also not strong — the scent will not overpower the room but instead it just leaves a subtle hint of something special in the air. I like candles like that because they make the house smell great but in a way that would make a guest think your home just naturally smells that way. I love it!
5,2018-03-10,"The Yankee Candle Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose Candle has been a joy to have in our home.  I must admit that over the years I have steered towards the cheapest candles I could find - we burn through quite a few.  But there is nothing quite like the quality of a Yankee Candle, and while more expensive than other brands, it has exceptional value.This item arrived packaged in an amazon box, and a Yankee box inside.  There were protective shells inside the Yankee box that would ensure that the force from a hard drop would be distributed throughout the protective shell, not the glass.  Well done.There was a ""NEW"" collar around the glass neck of the jar that needed to be removed.  While perforated, I still required a knife to cut this excess packaging away.  Sharp knife, awkward angle.  I'd have rather not had to do this but no big deal.The scent of the Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose is very clean and light.  It's fruity, and creates an aromatic ambiance in the room.  It is very pleasant and calming.  Even when unlit, the aroma is beautiful and powerful.  When lit, the scent shifts slightly into a more floral presence.  We love it.This candle has staying power also.  It will burn for many long hours and can be enjoyed for many days under heavy use.  The mottled wax used in this candle is of a higher quality than the less expensive candles to which I had grown accustomed.  The wick has a strong consistent burn, but if burned while exposed to a draft you may need to do a bit of wick maintenance every so often - keep the length at 1/8"" for best results.  When there is 1/2"" of wax left in the jar, it is time to dispose of the candle.Highly recommended!"
5,2018-03-18,"Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose smells just like the wild roses that were everywhere in the country when I was a kid, over 40 years ago.  I smell more rose when it's burning and the apricot when it's not lit.  The scent completely fills the den and the fragrance drifts into adjoining rooms but fainter.I've been burning the candle everyday for a week now and there is no soot or smoke buildup in the jar holder.  I see a little smoke when I blow the candle out but I've found that if I loosely cover the jar with tin foil, the air slowly diminishes in the jar and the flame goes out without a lot of smoke.Store brand candles are cheaper but their quality can't compare to Yankee Candles and Yankee Candles are made in the USA.The delicious scents make great gifts but I usually can't bear to part with it once I get it home.I did have one problem but I didn't deduct any stars because I was still able to use the candle and I do love the scent and the cleaner burn.The Jars are very thin and don't travel well.  The jar arrived cracked but I was not going to toss a perfectly good candle.  I removed the candle from the jar with a plastic coated mallet.  I left the candle in a deep cardboard box and made sure to cover my eyes and hands.  After a couple of taps with the mallet I was able to remove the candle and place it into a clear glass pillar candle holder.  Problem solved."
5,2018-03-24,"This is a big bright candle.The Yankee brand is consistent in quality, so I was pretty sure it would be scented perfectly, and the wax would be likely to melt down evenly.I have used about a third of the candle thus far and the surface is still even, no pit at all around the wick.Many candles become useless before they have been burned down to the suggested one third, due to uneven burning and a deepening pit around the wick each time you light the candle.That is not the case with this candle.I trim the wick before each burn, which helps keep the wax level consistent.The name of my scent is ""Color Me Happy.""It gives off an aroma of tropical fruit, pineapple being a noticeable component, pleasant and not overwhelming.This candle adds a warm glow to my bedroom after dark.Because it is a large one, the candle itself really stands out in its ombré shading from orange to yellow: a simple and effective form of mood lighting."
5,2019-05-08,"I discovered this scent a few years ago, and I’ve been obsessed with it ever since. I rely heavily on scents and fragrances, and love how they can immediately bring back vivid memories, and transport you to another place. The top note is a light, sweet melon, with a slight citrusy scent. It makes me think of Honeydew and Oranges. The heart is a soft, exotic floral that reminds me of the heady, intoxicating fragrance of the tiare flower. The base is a warm, slightly spicy, musky vanilla. For me, as the scents meld together, it reminds me of the watery, green scent I love so much. It truly does transport you to a secluded beach, the waves lapping at your feet, on an exotic island far away. They sell out quickly at my local supermarket so I always make sure to buy whatever they have in stock so I never run out. The wax tarts are a good size, with at least 24 hours of fragrance with the wax burner never being turned off. It’s a strong scent, enough to fill up a room, but soft enough to not be overpowering. If you love the ocean, you’ll love this."
5,2018-06-05,"Yankee Candle sets the bar exceptionally high for other candle makers.  They smell natural, lacking the abrasive chemical aromatic tones from many chandlers.  ""Sweet Nothings"" is no exception.  The scent wizards at Yankee Candle have somehow distilled the essence of calm and put it in wax.  This candle is pleasant without being overpowering, adding a nice accent to the room without screaming for your attention.  In short, it lives up to its name.I would be surprised if it actually lasts 100+ hours of burn time.  I would estimate we've had it burning for 20-30 hours cumulatively and it appears almost half gone.  It's still a good value."
5,2018-03-18,"I love Yankee Candles, so I trusted them to know how to make candle called Calm and Quiet Place. This does smell calming and relaxing!  The mixture of jasmine, patchouli, and amber musk does smell calm and quiet! The gray color of the candle is a nice, rich color that goes with most any décor. Yankee Candles are always made of paraffin-grade wax that melts evenly, delivering a fresh and calming scent throughout the entire life of the candle. This is a large, single-wick candle that measures 6.6"" x 4"", with a burning time of 110 to 150 hours. If you trim the natural fiber wick regularly, these candles do not smoke like some candles do. It is even boxed nicely enough to be appropriate for gift giving.I was given a free candle in exchange for an unbiased review."
5,2018-03-10,"I LOVE Yankee Candles and have been buying them for years.The sun drenched apricot rose is a nice soft spring time scent.  Just a touch of a rose scent to make your whole room smell wonderful.The large candles last such a long time.  So well worth the price.  Better yet, they have sales ALL the time that makes these even more affordable.I've had my neighbor tell me that when I have my doors and windows open, she can smell the scents all the way out on the street when she's walking her dog.  (I have candles burning in almost all my rooms)Right now I have the large candles, (different scents for the different seasons), and I have a large bag of tarts (also different scents for different seasons).  Eventually I will try out the plug ins.All the scents of these candles compliment each other.  So I can have different scents burning in different rooms and not have any of them clash with each other.For my birthday and for Christmas, I always ask for yankee candle gift cards.  And pictured are what I buy, to stock up for the year.These candles are a staple in our home."
5,2018-03-22,"I've been a fan of Yankee Candle for quite awhile but I've never heard of this new fragrance. This is a new one. It has a very subtle pleasant smell to it. One person that smelled it thought it smelled like the seashore to them. I think it smells like a baby or something baby related with a touch of powder to it. It has a slightly nostalgic yet familiar smell. I also smell sandalwood in it. Has a clean smell to it as well. Like a softer version of clean cotton. The smell reminds me of a baby, like another reviewer said. It's hard to explain that, but it does, it also reminds me of a crisp ocean breeze or the faint smell of the seashore. Usually, with a Yankee candle you get one straight scent coming to you, but with ones like this it's mixed scents, you can decide for yourself what it smells like, either way, if you like a light pleasing fragrance, you'll like this."
5,2018-05-25,"Yankee Candle has always been the ""creme de la creme"" when it comes to candle makers.  They smell natural, lacking the abrasive chemical olifactory tones from many chandlers.  ""A Calm & Quiet Place"" is no exception.  Maybe it's the power of the label's suggestion, but I feel like this candle is perfectly named.  The scent wizards at Yankee Candle have somehow distilled the essence of calm and put it in wax.  This candle is pleasant without being overpowering, adding a nice accent to the room without screaming for your attention.  In short, it lives up to its name.I would be surprised if it actually lasts 100+ hours of burn time.  I would estimate we've had it burning for 20-30 hours cumulatively and it appears almost half gone.  It's still a good value."
5,2020-05-02,"I didn’t realize yankee candles could be so top quality with the affordable price of the large jars! I’m a candle feign.. hands down the white gardenia is the bomb dot com! It lasts forever!!! It’s not overpowering, not sweet (ew), it’s gentle and makes my space feel refreshed. I got the lavender vanilla too and that one is a little too sweet for me.. if you like vanillas and such, youde enjoy it... also not overwhelming but def present. I just ordered lilac blossoms and sunshine something based off the reviews I read. Didn’t want the pink sands since I saw it smells like a 16 year old girls room. Totally recommend these, trust!"
5,2015-06-01,"Scent traveled quickly throughout my house in minutes, not hours. Heady scent reminds me of burying your nose in a rose bush full of Tiffany blossoms. Smells exactly like the unlit candle...in fact, I can just leave the lid off the unlit candle and sitting 6' away I can still smell it. Thankfully, this wonderful scent, doesn't bother my allergies. Burns very clean with no wax left on the glass. It smells exactly as I hoped it would. Very pretty clear pink color; unlit it reminds me of Tiffany's, lit its almost identical to a Lovestruck Rose.I bought 
  
Fresh Cut Roses







  
  
     and 
  
True Rose







  
  
     jar candles directly from Yankee Candle, so I could compare them, as I couldn't find a review that did. It's hard not having access to a store to check out scents. I appreciate it when others write scent descriptions. I love the 'Fresh Cut Roses' candle scent, it's not an overpowering scent which the True Rose almost is. True Rose is a deep red candle. The unlit candle reminds me of a bouquet of red florist roses. It has a heavier, deeply damask rose scent when lit, but it doesn't carry that well. Basically, they smell like the color of roses they portray. I'll buy the Fresh Cut Roses candle again, but not the True Rose."
5,2018-03-22,"I am loving this new Yankee candle scent! It's sweet, but not at all over powering like some sweet and sugary scents. The smell is really hard to describe. It smells like some kind of treat mixed with some mild flowers.I'm not crazy about most floral scented candles. I'm not even sure this one has any floral in it.  It evokes feelings of happiness and joy. I've been burning this in the kitchen. I smell it when I enter the kitchen area, but I really don't notice it in the adjacent living room or hallway. I have lit this at least three times so far, for periods of approximately 4 hours each time. The wax level has hardly gone down at all. I will probably have to order this again when it's finished."
5,2018-03-19,"Yankee always produces a quality candle well worth the cost.  The glass container is thick enough to be safe and the lid fits tight enough to keep the scent in when it is not being used.  Being a single wick jar you will need to burn this for at least a half hour at a time to allow the pool of wax to reach the edges of the jar insuring even burning the next time you use it.The scent is light and fresh and reminds me of summer.  (The description says it contains tropical sunlight).  The Mango is the strongest scent with hints of peach and vanilla.  Peach Mango Salsa is one of my absolute favorite summer scents, but so far I like this one just as well.The color is also nice and cheery so that it brightens up the room (even when it isn't lit)."
5,2018-03-27,"With scented candles I want specific things. Easy to light and a wick that doesn't blossom or smoke. I want a good scent before it is lit and I need it to put out the same fragrance after it is lit. This Sweet Nothings version of Yankee Candle in their large jar meets all of my criteria for an excellent scented candle.The scent reminded me of sweet tarts, the sugar little candies that I'm sure many of you reading this review are familiar with. After I lit it, the scent was immediately noticeable and it built up to fill the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room areas of a 2000+ square foot home. Unfortunately one of my family members really hates sweet tarts so I had to stop burning it about half an hour before he got home."
5,2018-03-08,"I have used and loved Yankee candles for a long time and they never disappoint. The “early spring blooms” and “wildflower blooms” both have a very fresh and subtle scent. You really don’t get the full effect until the second burn. The large jar size should be burned about four hours the first time, leaving the wax to pool.The candle burns cleanly and for a long time. If you prefer the column, double-wick or tumbler design, which are more modern looking, those are available also.  The labels are easy to remove if you want to use several candles together as a table-scape. You get the ambience of candlelight and a gentle  scent without the  in-your-face odor of a plug-in room deodorizer."
5,2018-04-13,"I'm a great fan of candles and am always on the look out for new and exciting fragrances. Yankee Candles are downright my favorite brand of candle and, believe me, I have tried more brands than I'm comfortable admitting. This is consistently the cleanest-burning candle with the best wick that causes no trouble and requires no trimming or fussing with throughout its life cycle. I've enjoyed this fragrance a lot, and even though this brand might be pricier than others, the sheer quality of the product makes it worth buying."
5,2018-03-22,"I love Yankee Candles! I have been using them for years. They are the best when it comes to clean scents, long burns, and scent diffusion.The new scent, ""A Calm and Quiet Place"" is a candle that I think about for rainy days curled up with a book. It smells on the sweeter side, and reminds me of baby powder, lavender, and slight overtones of ocean (sandalwood, maybe?). To catch the best scent, smell the lid of the jar and not the jar itself.The candle is in a durable glass jar, that can be reused for crafts, storing pens and pencils, and holding things like buttons. I like that the jar is glass and can be recycled if you do not have a repurpose for it."
5,2018-09-27,We have had other products from Yankee Candle and this is one of their best.  There are times when the lights go out because the power gets interrupted.  A real help to keeping the room well lit when  you need it.Another use we found was for ambiance out on the patio during the evening.  We have a nice patio and putting this on our table rather than having lights overhead.  Because this is larger than most jar candles we like that when the wind blows the flame does not flicker and then get blown out.This is also a great gift item that you would be really thanked a lot for giving.
5,2018-04-13,"I love candles of all kinds, from unscened tea lights to large 3 wick 6"" candles.  I am partial scented candles, though.  I just love the ambiance of lighting the candle and enjoying a pleasant scent.  My favorite scents are usually beachy smelling ones, whether it is a tropical bloom like a plumeria, or coconutty sun tanning lotion.Yankee candles are expensive, but they burn so nicely without waste, that you really do get your money's worth.  This scent is perfect for people who like gentle and calming scents.  It is very subtle and in the background, giving a bit of atmosphere to the room, without being overcloying."
5,2022-02-09,"The Wild Orchid Yankee Candle smells absolutely amazing. The smell is not over powering like some candles can be. It is like being at my brother in law’s wedding in Mexico with all the flowers around us, while we burned it. The scent is great and it burned evenly."
5,2018-03-11,This candle smells so nice. I see other reviews saying it has a musk scent but I don’t get that at all. To me it smells like a soft floral mix. It’s one of those scents that’s nice to have in the background. It’s not overpowering or something people can quickly identify.The large jar style yankee candles are a favorite of mine. They last a long time as long as I’m careful to allow them to stay even. If it’s not lit long enough the wax will wear down in the center. Just a bit and it’s fixable by cutting away the wax around the edge before lighting it again but too much and it won’t be usable as long as it should have been.
5,2018-04-05,"I have bought Yankee candles for decades because I love the quality and many of the fragrances. The sun-drenched apricot smells so fresh and is perfect for spring. The color is also really pretty and brightens up a shelf or counter. As with all Yankee candles, it's important that you burn it long enough to melt the wax all the way across the candle or you will get a ""divet"" that will eventually make the candle useless because the wax will keep putting out the flame. It's also a good idea to trim the wick as low as possible before you light it. This will make it melt across the top a little faster."
5,2018-04-11,"I've been a long-time fan of Yankee Candle's candles, so I was happy to try out one of their new candle scents, Color Me Happy. The scent is a delicious scent that is perfect for spring and summer. The scent has tropical elements to it. Pineapple is what I notice the most with mango being the second noticeable scent. I noticed the scent not long after lighting the wick but it is not overwhelming at all.Co The orange colored wax and flowers on the label also make this candle the perfect decoration for the spring and summer season."
5,2018-03-21,"Yankee Candle is probably my favorite candle manufacturer. The scents the candles produce are light and refreshing. Some candles have heavy fake smells and others just have a bad smell. The Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Calm and Quiet Place is another great candle by Yankee Candle. The scent is calming which is surprised me because I wasn't sure what ""calm and quiet"" would smell like. The  effect was very pleasant.I recommend the Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Calm and Quiet Place to anyone who enjoys Yankee Candles. It would also be a great gift for someone. Try it, you will enjoy it."
5,2018-04-17,"Yankee Candles are known for their high quality and amazing scents.  This new addition is a wonderful addition to their line.  These candles are well packed so they won't shift around or break.  When burning this candle it is a highly fragranced candle the delightful fruity scent will soon diffuse through the room.To me this is a great refreshing spring scent, it smells fruity to me it is a somewhat citrusy scent that may be like Starbursts, or perhaps Fruit Loops.  I love enjoyed this long burning candle."
5,2018-03-11,"I've long been a fan of Yankee Candles.  They are of excellent quality, burn evenly and nicely, and they last a really long time.  This candle is no exception.  The ""Sweet Nothings"" scent is nice for bathrooms or for a nursery.  I would describe the scent as ""sweet baby powder,"" as it does live up to its name.  This would make an excellent gift!  Update: Be sure to keep the wick trimmed so that the jar doesn't get all sooty.  This will keep the candle looking better."
5,2018-03-21,"Yankee Candle Company always provides high quality candles for those special occasions. This white candle has the aroma of early spring or late winter. The aroma can capture the room environment as if they were fresh flowers in the home. The aroma can capture the room and environment to create a flowery smell. If you like candles, you will definitely enjoy this large jar candle for a gift or for yourself.Sometimes, you have to treat yourself. The Yankee Candle comes in a large jar and will last for a long time if only burns a few hours a day."
5,2021-12-12,"Been buying my mom this candle every holiday for years.. she still asks for it as a gift to get her lol. Smells great, scent usually lasts long and lets face it. Who doesn't want to feel like their at the beach when its currently freezing outside lol. Great candle to relax with!"
5,2016-09-05,"My new favorite Yankee scent.  I tend to like fresh and floral scents.  I would describe this a little more on the floral end of the spectrum.  If you remember and loved ""Hearts and Flowers"" you will like this fragrance.  I have one very old Hearts and Flowers (discontinued) candle and the fragrances are almost identical."
5,2022-08-16,Single wicks allow for more burn time..double wicks obviously has 2 wicks burning which increases how fast it burns And you will not get the maximum hours of burn time
5,2015-08-18,"are with us such a sort time each summer, and this a is perfect replication of their scent. It's like I just went and buried my nose in my neighbor's 65 year old lilac bush. Just like real lilac blossoms, the scent is a very strong with a heaviness to it. This scent keeps building the longer it burns. Candle has a great throw. When I first lit this, there was a soapy smell to it but that left quickly. Cold color is true to the lavender variety of lilacs. The wax pool color is true to the purple variety. This candle has not tunneled. The scent is as wonderful as I hoped and thankfully, it does not bother my allergies."
5,2018-04-13,"The aptly named ""calm and quiet place"" candle from Yankee candles lives up to its name.  It has a very calm, pleasing scent that doesn't overwhelm the room but does make it feel inviting and peaceful.  The soft mauve color of the candle is unobtrusive.  The candle was much larger than I expected, has a single wick and is projected to burn for approximately 110-150 hours.  While it may not become everyone's favorite scent, I also cannot imagine anyone finding it objectionable so is a great candle to burn when entertaining guests."
5,2022-01-27,Yankee candles never disappoint and have been my go to candle for many years. Always a great and lasting scent. Giftable as well. I have a few different scents at home and pull them out depending on my mood.
5,2020-05-23,I gave this Fresh Cut Roses Yankee candle to my mom as she loves roses. Yankee candle didn’t disappoint! She loved the candle & says it smells so much like roses she’d think freshly roses were sitting in her living room. The candle was packaged securely & was in mint condition. I gifted this quite some time ago & it’s still burning strong. Definitely recommend!
5,2020-10-12,"Yankee Candle is a famous brand and I have used it all the time. I bought the pink sands scent Candle from Amazon this time. It is much cheaper compared to the retail store in the mall. The package is well protected. I really like the scent when I open it, the scent is not too strong and it makes me feel relax. I will buy it again as a Christmas gift for my family, nice candle and great experience."
5,2018-04-07,"I love this scent. While not a food type of scent, it still gives off a warm and cozy fragrance. The scent is not overwhelming or cloy yet it does cover a large area. It's not overly floral or perfume-like but has a warm, relaxing smell. It's hard to really describe the smell. The candle burns nicely without a lot of smoke. I like that it has a lid since it makes it easier to put the candle flame out. Just place the lid on. I like that the scent is unique and is something my whole family can agree that we like."
5,2018-03-05,I haven't had a Yankee Candle in years and I forgot how wonderful they smell. The apricot rose scent makes me think of spring and it is such a nice aroma to make me feel hopeful while snowed-in. It burns for hours as long as you keep the wick trimmed. I had it burning all day yesterday and would just trim the wick every couple of hours and it looked almost new still. I wish these were soy as that is my preference but I think I will treat myself every once in awhile to a wonderfully scented Yankee Candle.
5,2018-03-23,"Okay - I'm going to rave about this Yankee Candle. So many candles with fragrance are on the extremes -- either the fragrance is so underwhelming that I'm thinking, ""Why bother,"" or it's so strong and pungent that I'm bowled over by a wall of fake perfume. This candle has a VERY nice, pleasant fragrance that I thoroughly enjoy. It's name, A Calm & Quiet Place, is very appropriate, too. It creates a nice, pleasant atmosphere that I really like.  Five stars for sure .Highly recommended."
5,2018-03-05,"This ""Calm and Quiet Place"" candle has a nice scent--kind of a combination of lavender and floral. Yankee Candles are high quality--I have one and am glad to add this one to my collection. Gray is kind of the ""in"" color for interior decor, so this gray-colored candle fits right into cool gray decor like I have in our master bedroom. Follow the directions on the bottom of the candle to get many hours of enjoyment. Note: these candles should be stored upright, especially in hot weather."
5,2020-02-01,"I am not a big candle person.  I rarely buy candles or even like the smell of most of them.  But this one, the Pink Sands by Yankee Candle, I like a lot.  It has a nice sweet and sugary feminine scent, but not too overpowering.(btw, I bought the gel beads version of Pink Sands by Yankee Candle, that one stinks and smell nothing like this one!)"
5,2018-03-14,"Ohhhhhhhh!  Such a light springy fragrance!  I love it!  A nice mixture of spring flower fragrances that make you feel like you are in a field of Spring flowers!  Nice and mild and light and not overpowering.  A very pleasant addition to the Yankee Candle family of candles.  I often buy Lavender, Harvest and Fresh Cut Roses Yankee Candles and now I added Color Me Happy to my favorites list.  Great job Yankee Candle!!"
5,2020-12-06,"I wish there were more rose scented candles, they are hard to find. But, this one won't disappoint.  The wax lasts a LONG time and the scent fills the entire downstairs of my house. I don't care for the cost of Yankee candles but you get what you pay for in this instance."
5,2019-07-20,"This arrived perfect, NOT broken as some reviews have indicated. It was packaged very well. Using a cardboard insert to cushion the candle, it was placed inside a snug fitting box which was then nested inside a larger one. It seemed to offer a great deal of protection.The candle itself burns well and has a great scent, that in my opinion, is not ""perfumy"" or overpowering."
5,2018-03-12,It has been a few years since I have had a Yankee Candle and I remember now what a good product it is. I have the large jar in Early Spring. It is a light and fresh floral scent and the color of the candle is pure white. The candle burns nice and slowly and will last a long time. Once it warms up it gives off a nice scent that without dominating the room. When you blow out the candle there is only a minimal amount of smoke and there is virtually no debris from the burnt wick.
5,2018-03-12,"Large high-quality candle in a sturdy jar.Likes:-  Quality wax and wick.- Aroma. Smells good, floral undertones but not overly sweet. Aroma is not too strong IMO.- Sturdy jar with nice cap that seals.- Large size. Lasts longer.  You'll get many nice evenings out of this candle.Dislikes:- None.Other thoughts;- Keep the wick trimmed, erring on the side of a short wick, as small as 1/4"" long."
5,2018-03-20,"I love Yankee Candles and am so happy I can order them from Amazon!The packaging was great, a cardboard mold holds the candle to keep it from sliding, then two boxes for added stability.The jasmin scent is light and not too overwhelming like some floral scented Yankee Candles can be.  Best of all, these candles burn for a long time.  Even after burning it several times a week for over a month, the candle is has much burning lift left."
5,2018-03-09,"What a great name for a candle! This did, indeed, Color Me Happy! The scent is a mango flavor, with some light citrus notes. It's sweet without being cloying. Makes me smile every time I catch the scent.Yankee Candles are my go-to for my own home, as well as for gifts. They smell delicious, last for a good long while, and aren't overly oily, so the scent is in the air, but you don't feel like it's invading your lungs. Love this flavor!"
5,2018-03-18,"This is part of Yankee Candle's new Spring collection. It is a ""sweet"" subtle scent that is pleasant but not obtrusive, perfect for guests or relaxing. The official description of the scent of Yankee Candle's website is:Fragrance Notes:Cyclamen?Lotus Blossom?Vanilla, Powdery MuskTop note is the initial impression of the fragrance, middle note is the main body of the scent and base is its final impression."
5,2018-05-02,"This is by far my favorite Yankee Candle scent.  Color me Happy has a light peach scent, perfect for spring and summer.  The wick is high quality and will burn for hours without any black smoke, as some of the less expensive candles sometimes do.  I get many compliments on the scent and the pretty orange color brings a bit of fun to the room decor!  This is a large candle jar and I believe it will take me all summer to burn through it."
4,2018-03-10,"This is a new fragrance from Yankee Candle's Spring line. I found the fragrance soft and pleasing, but not one of my favorites. For some reason it reminded me of a baby's room (in a good way). I have dozens of Yankee Candles and they remain my favorite brand.For your reference this is the detailed description of the fragrance from the Yankee Candle website:A centered fragrance—balanced with gentle jasmine, a whisper of patchouli, and warm amber musk.Fragrance Notes:Mandarin LeafJasmine, CedarwoodPatchouli, Sandalwood, Amber MuskTop note is the initial impression of the fragrance, middle note is the main body of the scent and base is its final impression."
5,2018-04-17,"Smells amazing!-I didn't even know you could get Yankee Candle on here.  Crazy.  I've been to their facility out in Western Mass.  It was ages ago but I'm sure it's still there!These have always been everyone's favorite candle.  Best scents, best smelling, best burning.  Huge thumbs up!-This new ""flavor""/scent is awesome - very fresh and floral.  Perfect for spring, if it ever gets here!!!"
5,2018-03-11,"My wife is particular about candle fragrances, but this one seems to have passed the smell test. She says it has a nice ""summer"" smell. She guessed a mix of mango, pineapple and floral, but I see from the description there's peach and vanilla (which she loves) in there too.Otherwise, it is a standard, high-quality Yankee Candle, the likes of which have been part of our home for many, many years. I recommend it."
4,2015-06-01,"Color and smell remind me of a Mister Lincoln Rose. This candle has a very heavy, almost overpowering, damask scent. The scent does not travel nearly as far, nor as quickly, as their 
  
Fresh Cut Roses Candle







  
  
    , which I prefer. Not sure why, but this scent carries better with the house all closed up, though I can still barely smell it 5' away. This scent does not bother my allergies. Burns very clean, with no tunneling. Smells exactly as I would expect a good quality bouquet of red roses from a florist to smell. I mainly just want 1 dozen red roses in 1 area, whose scent travels around my little home, not 10 dozen sitting in a small area.It's hard not having access to a store to check out each scent, so I appreciate it when I see a scent description. I bought 
  
True Rose







  
  
     and Fresh Cut Roses jar candles directly from Yankee Candle, so I could compare them, as I couldn't find a review that did. Having had the candles for a while now, I can honestly say I will buy the 
  
Fresh Cut Roses







  
  
     again, but not the True Rose. It's not the scent I was hoping for, the 'Fresh Cut Roses' candle is. It's scent, is not so overpowering. It reminds me of Tiffany Roses, and has a great throw. Basically, they both smell like the color of roses they portray."
5,2015-01-01,"This smells NOTHING like sand, but I don't think sand has a distinguishable scent, so I'm pretty positive that the chemists at Yankee Candle used their imagination with this one. This is a WONDERFUL scent. Yankee Candle claims that this scent is a blend of floral, citrus, and vanilla, but I cannot sense any of those three components in the candle at all. It smells more to me like a typical ""ocean breeze"" scent combined with cotton candy. Call me crazy or just overly creative, but this is exactly what it smells like in my opinion. It's very beachy, yet very sweet at the same time. Perfect for summer! It's also very calming and relaxing."
5,2015-12-08,"If you like lilacs, then this is the candle for you.  The scent, when burning gives the room a subtle scent of lilac blossoms, which normally I can only enjoy for an ever so brief time in the spring.  The branches, when picked, wilt all too quickly and the scent fades, but this candle means you can enjoy the scent again and again...even in the dead of winter.The candle comes in a nice, heavy glass jar.  This makes a great gift for those who adore the smell of lilacs."
5,2018-03-10,"The new Yankee Candle Wildflower Blooms Large Jar Candle is a winner. Even though I have a preference for the more masculine woodland and fresh scents such as Sandalwood, I can appreciate this candle. the wildflower fragrance isn't overpowering to most people and the presentation of the candle is quite attractive. The green candle wax will fit in with most decor. I find that if I have been away for a few days and find the house a little less than fresh, this and other Yankee candles are lifesavers when guests drop by on short notice before I can clean and get everything fresh again. Not only does lighting them work well to fragrance the air but if I want a lighter fragrance, I can take the lid off and the air will take on a light fragrance. These candles burn longer than most candles with fragrance that I have purchased. Yankee Candles makes the claim that the continuous burn life of these candles is 110 to 150 hours. That is probably correct although I did have a Yankee Candle that burned over 200 hours. The lid securely keeps in the fragrance when the candle isn't in use. After it is burned out, the jar can be used in a number of decorative ways and can even securely store candy if it is first cleaned properly. I like it."
5,2022-04-09,"The candle is pink which is amazing to start and in the beginning, the scent is very powerful."
5,2021-10-01,I tried this fragrance and it brings family memories.  I love the fragrance when i wasn' t sure if I would.  I would recommend this one.
5,2022-07-07,"Arrived quick and packed nicely. Love the scent, very light and clean."
3,2022-02-12,"There has to be something wrong with the smelling ability of the creators and testers at Yankee candle or with the people that name the candles . This ""Pink Sands"" candle, described as an ""island getaway"", smells more like tropical fruit bubblegum than a tropical beach. Ive been to islands all over the world and not a single one has smelled like overly ripe strawberries, musk and vanilla. I don't understand all the rave reviews. Maybe a very young girl would like it? The overly sweet scent aside, the candle is long lasting, even burning  and has a strong throw - typical of most Yankee candles. The decorative large glass jar with the heavy lid that seals is very giftable. The candle came safely packaged inside an egg crate box within another Yankee box. The candle scent was so strong, I could smell it through both shipping boxes."
5,2021-04-24,"I absolutely LOVE this scent! I was excited to find it on Amazon at a good price. Quality, long lasting candle, like you would expect from Yankee Candle Company."
5,2018-03-11,"I love this candle! Yankee does such a great job with their candles. This particular one has a faint lilac/lavender scent to it. It's sweet, but not overpowering.I have this burning on my kitchen island most days, and it fills the kitchen/dinning room area with a subtle floral scent. Very pleased with this candle...would absolutely recommend it!"
5,2019-04-25,"Yankee Candles are usually expensive in stores but this candle was reasonably priced. I thought the scent would be of fresh roses but it literally smells like fresh cut roses aka the stems so I was slightly disappointed. But overall, it was good for the price and the color is perfect for spring."
4,2018-05-28,"I fell in love with Yankee Candle many years ago when I partook in the Yankee Candle Tour at the factory in Deerfield, Massachusetts.Of course, Yankee candle is expensive, but, overall, the manufacturers apparently use the top-shelf ingredients and the candles last forever; well, not forever, but they have a elongated burning time.Over the last few years, I’ve avoided candles, largely due to a friend who clamors about the toxins that they release. However, I couldn’t resist Yankee Candle’s newest addition to the scent family, Color Me Happy.I prefer the large size for a longer-burning experience. Oddly, the wax looked spotted, as you can see from my attached photo. I’m not sure if that is typical, because like I said earlier, I have been off candles. Anyway, the scent is utterly sweet-sweet-sweet. Did I say, sweet? Fruity and flowery. If you are into a more mellow, subtle scent, Color Me Happy will not make you happy.Anyway, I conducted a bit of internet research and discovered an interesting article about the toxins in candles. I have included an excerpt of the article below.“While the candle industry insists that the final product is inert, studies have shown that the burning of paraffin candles releases benzene and toluene — both known carcinogens — into the atmosphere. And even if you buy a high-end candle, it doesn't make it any safer. Candles from retailers like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Yankee Candle Store, and Crate & Barrel are mostly made from paraffin.To add to all this, artificial dyes and synthetic fragrances are often added to candles, especially those used in aromatherapy. The recipe varies from candle to candle, but the fragrances and dyes — which are often synthetic — can contain toxic plasticizers and solvents, which should be avoided. Also, those extra ingredients also burn, which means additional soot.If you can't live without your candles, consider those made of beeswax or vegetable oils, and with natural dyes and perfumes.”Of course, it is up to the consumer if they prefer to keep purchasing the Yankee or any other candle brand. After this Yankee candle, I think I’ll stay off for a while – but I do find them hard to resist! 3.5 stars"
5,2018-03-05,"This is a large, pretty candle with a light floral fragrence.  I burned it for several hours yesterday and it burned cleanly with no smoking and black soot left on the candle or jar.  It didn't leave an overwhelming scent in the room.  Yankee Candles are always high quality and this one follows suit.  The reusable glass jar is also high quality."
5,2020-10-18,This is my absolutely favorite scent and it smells so delightful & is lingering throughout the living room. This is a beautiful gift to give to someone and a quality product.
5,2021-08-08,"Delivery time was fast, the scent is wonderful. Will definitely keep buying and recommend to my friends."
5,2022-03-30,I have pets and this scent is a great way to keep the stink down.The candle lasts long and it is relaxing.
5,2020-04-28,Love this scent! It is a very true to the flower scent. Not overpowering but nicely fills a couple rooms with scent. Long lasting and burns nicely. Have been buying this scent for years and will continue to buy!!
5,2021-01-29,"These candles are always good.  I bought these as a gift.  I've purchase for myself as well.  Great scents, never a compliant."
5,2020-12-31,I love the scent of these candles.  I don't even need to burn them for the room to smell like lilac.  They will last for a very long time. I gifted these for my In-laws but definitely saved one for myself.  they were so excited to get them.  They are a perfect gift for any female.  They were delivered very fast with no problems.I received an Amazon gift card from my brother and guess what?  I am getting MORE!
5,2021-05-07,The Sun Drenched Apricot Rose scent from Yankee Candle is one of my favorites! Makes my house smell delicious! Great candle
5,2018-06-16,"This candle is huge and the scent is really refreshing. It's not overly perfumey but has a nice sweet scent that lingers for a while even after the candle has been blown out. It's large size will guarantee a long, slow burn, the purple color is really pretty as well. Would make an excellent gift. Highly recommend"
5,2019-12-19,"Loved this one. Smells like grapefruit, the beach, and a pina colada. Very light and crisp and clean, perfect for summertime. Makes me think of the beach. Sweet smelling without being overpowering. Was pleasantly surprised."
5,2019-02-05,"I love it, I love it, I love it! It is a very unisex scent and both my husband and I enjoy it burning. It arrived quickly, in perfect shape, and packed very well. No wonder this one is always out of stock. Buy it if you get a chance!"
5,2022-05-24,It smells like a field of lilac
5,2022-03-21,Great smelling candle.  Lasts a long time.

I mainly just want 1 dozen red roses in 1 area, whose scent travels around my little home, not 10 dozen potent roses sitting in a small area.It's hard not having access to a store to check out each scent, so I appreciate it when I see a scent description. I bought 
  
True Rose







  
  
     and Freshly Cut Roses jar candles directly from Yankee Candle, so I could compare them, as I couldn't find a review that did. Having had the candles for a while now, I can honestly say I will buy the 
  
Fresh Cut Roses







  
  
     again, but not the True Rose. It's not the scent I was hoping for, the 'Freshly Cut Roses' candle is. It's scent, is not so overpowering, as it reminds me of Tiffany Roses. Basically, they both smell like the color of roses they portray."
5,2021-05-24,"One of my favorite Yankee Candle scenes. Definitely recommend, great scent for a bedroom or living room!"
5,2021-07-22,"You don't know how it's going to smell when you buy it on-line, but the jasmine is great."
4,2018-04-10,"4.5 StarsIf you are familiar with Yankee Candles, Color Me Happy is yet another wonderful fragrance they have added to their catalog. For those unfamiliar you're in for a real aromatic treat!This 6""x4"" jar candle from Yankee Candles is called Color Me Happy. A lush mix of mango, peaches and vanilla - the aroma is strong without being overwhelming. The jar itself is thick, with an air-tight, rubber sealed lid. Hold on - don't toss the lid. First leaving the candle sealed until you're ready to lit it, keeps all those rich, textured aromas in the jar. I remove the lid, leaving the candle unlit, and within minutes I can smell a hint of vanilla, peaches and mango. I left the lid off, candle remained unlit, for 2 hours in our 16x20 den and the aroma was wonderful - it was light...but definitely noticeable.The second reason I keep the lid is the probably the most important - replacing the lid Immediately after extinguishing the flame, if there's any ""black smoke"" it is kept inside.I burned this candle several times a day. . .usually 2 hours, resulting in an evenly melted 1/4"" or wax. It is VERY Important to Always trim the wick before each re-lighting of the candle. (*Never trim the wick until the wax has hardened.) Many of the other candles I have burned do not melt evenly no matter what I do. I bought a ""candle shade"" (Just like a shade for lamps, except it's made for candles.) I love the shade. It extends the life of the candle and looks beautiful too. I am a candle fanatic! I have bought just about every brand name that offers fragrances I like - and it has been my experience that Yankee Candles have consistent aromas, longer life, and barely any black, smokey residue. Yes, the price is on the high end...but the experience is too. I definitely have no problem recommending this candle."
5,2018-03-07,"Yankee candles are always quality products, with the solid, elegant looking jar and a variety of wonderful scents.  This candle is no different; fills a room with a light wonderful scent without overpowering the occupants.  Smells like a very light mixture of vanilla and lavender; very pretty and relaxing."
5,2021-06-23,"A few years ago I switched my candles from Yankee to another brand. Because it was a really good deal on Amazon I decided to give it a go. As soon as I burn it, the smell is super fresh filling the whole living room! I will definitely buy again!"
5,2018-03-09,"This is like summer in a candle- it's a light floral and slightly fruit smell, but not obnoxious.  Sometimes Yankee candles can be overpowering, but this one burned for well over an hour and stayed light.  If you're looking for a stronger scent, this one isn't it.  Huge jar so this one will last a long time!"
5,2018-03-05,"I love the scent of this Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose scented candle. The scent is strong, but very clearly apricot and rose scented. These Yankee Candles are very high quality and can warm up the decor of a room. Do pay attention to the directions on the bottom of the jar to make sure you enjoy your candle safely."
5,2011-08-27,"I really enjoy items that have a rose scent. In addition, I have a bathroom decorated in a light pink and white color scheme. This Yankee Candle in Fresh Cut Roses made a perfect addition to my bathroom's decor. It's a pale, almost vintage pink color. The fragrance is bold and realistic. The scent from this candle when it is lit carries throughout the house. It burns nicely, and I haven't had any issue with tunneling. I absolutely love it!"
5,2021-07-18,It’s a Yankee Candle.  The scent is true to roses. It’s pink. Pretty close to perfect.
5,2021-09-01,The scent fills my entire house. I love this candle. It is beautiful and lasts for a very long time.
5,2018-08-21,"I purchased the large jar for my son. Wasn't sure he would like it. I was visiting him recently and he was burning the candle. I realized that the wax was very low, almost gone! It has a very nice smell so now I'm going to purchase the Island Waterfall for him again, since he obviously liked it!"
5,2021-10-30,"Nice candle. Great quality, scent is good."
5,2017-05-19,My mom was thrilled with this candle.  And I was very happy with the service from Amazon.  They let me know that her item couldn't be delivered as wanted but that was my fault.  I didn't remember she was going out of town.  So it was delivered to the post office and she picked it up Wednesday and they let me know she picked it up.
5,2020-06-07,I received this as a gift. This is my first experience with this scent of Yankee candle. I absolutely love it and it is my new favorite.
5,2021-04-01,These candles burn well all the way to the bottom. They smell so nice!
5,2013-11-12,I just LOVE the scent of this candle! I didn't even know Yankee Candle made a scent like this. My husband knows that I love candles and surprised me by lighting a bunch of tea lights on our wedding day. I loved the scent so much that I ordered the large jar just to bring me back to the memory of our special wedding day. It smells of light white roses and I don't think the scent is overly powerful.
5,2019-07-25,"This is a great scent for summer, it's refreshing but almost fruity? Hard to describe entirely. These candles always fill the whole room/house with the scent and it lasts a while! Great deal!"
5,2010-12-17,"first off, i'm not a candle fan; however, i am a huge rose one.  this is the first candle i've ever spent money on, and i can't stop sniffing it.  nothing i own smells exactly like a real rose, even Jurlique's rose body oil (which is divine!) doesn't smell precisely of a fresh cut beaut. This, though, smells exactly like the real deal! Plus, I read somewhere that bubblegum pink relieves stress (that's why they paint some jail cell's that color!), and this scent combined with that color and the beautiful glass--it's a winner by every means.  hectic days are still here, but the stress isn't. :)"
5,2020-07-27,Yankee candles are my favorite ever.  They burn evenly all the way to the bottom.  Scents are authentic and throw is good.
3,2020-07-26,"The good: This candle lasts forever. I have been burning it nonstop for about 7-8 hours and barely any of it has melted down. It puts off a nice glow and makes my room feel cozy. The bad: I can't smell anything at all. On cold sniff, it has a little bit of a smell, but after burning for this long, I still don't smell anything. I will say, that I have had this candle for quite some time now (at least a year) so maybe that is why there is no smell."
5,2022-01-29,Great price
4,2018-05-01,"So, I'm not sure that I would describe the scent of this as ""A Calm & Quiet Place"" unless maybe you feel like your ""Calm & Quiet Place"" is at your grandma's house, which IS some people's  ""Calm & Quiet Place"" but...anyway...what I'm trying to say is that this is very ""perfume-y"" for me. Not that it smells bad, just very floral. The description says: ""A meditative fragrance—balanced and centered with gentle jasmine, a whisper of patchouli and warm amber musk."" It's okay, just not my favorite. BUT...it could be your favorite...I don't know. So, in general, the candle is not a bad price for what you get. The large jar is pretty big, and should last a good long time. Packed very well. I was afraid of this glass jar being shipped and that it might crack in shipment, but it was packed so well, there was no chance of that. Well done, Yankee Candle!"
5,2017-02-15,"The Wedding Day smell is by far my favorite out of anything Yankee sells. I got it as a present at my bridal shower and have loved it ever since. It isn't overpowering yet you can still smell it in the room when lit. It smells like a combination of baby powder and light floral scents, a little like roses and peonies."
5,2018-07-16,"This is a light fragrance that I think should have been called ""Pink Champagne"" instead of Pink Sands. There is nothing ""Beachy"" about it. Its lovely and I would recommend it if you want a light fruity like scent."
4,2018-07-05,"This candle is lasting forever! It smells very nice, I just have one problem, the candle doesn't smell much when burning, at least not compared to all other Yankee candles I've tried. The smell it does give off is very faint, and has a clean smell to it. If I place the candle on the end table next to me I can smell it, but if I walk ten feet away, I can't, even if it's been burning for hours. It is very nice for ambiance, though. I like to light it in the evening on the end table next to me as I write. I am amazed at how much I've burnt it, yet it only has burned down halfway. It's very long lasting. I will definitely purchase Yankee candles more in the future, as I have for years, because they're so high quality. However, I won't be getting this scent again because it doesn't smell much."
5,2019-09-22,"Realmente buena, suele ser un item no muy barato, per vale su precio, el aroma ambiental es agradable, aunque no se enciende diariamente, se nota que tiende a ser de larga duracion."
5,2019-01-04,"Both 22oz tumbler and jar are essentially the same weight. As you can see in the pictures, the jar is wider and shorter, the tumbler is slightly thinner but taller. Hope this calms you down a bit."
5,2021-02-24,This has my room smelling like it a rosebush! Great scent!
5,2020-12-01,Smells fabulous.... I burn it all night long and have ever since it arrived at my home!! I will be ordering more!💕
5,2018-05-21,"Sometimes a candle smell can overwhelm or be offensive to some. This slow burning candle has a very subtle but lovely scent that I found very relaxing.  As all Yankee Candles, it is of the highest quality. I plan to order more!"
5,2018-03-12,"I wasn't sure about this when I just lifted off the lid and smelled it; I was a little overpowered by the gardenias in the fragrance blend of this. It smells a lot like a flowery perfume.  However, using it delivers a somewhat gentler perfumey scent, and quickly.  I lit the candle and literally within minutes I could smell it all the way across the downstairs.  I've never used a Yankee Candle, but I can see why they are popular. The scent is dramatically strong, and much better at infusing through the house than other methods of home-scenting that I've tried (like aromatherapy misters and cheaper scented candles)."
5,2020-11-15,I’m really happy with this candle. Smells really nice and fresh and has lasted me so long. Will purchase again!
5,2021-07-13,My favorite scent.
3,2018-03-06,"Yankee Candle makes quality (albeit pricey) candles that last for months if you use them as infrequently as I do. This new scent, ""Wildflower Blooms,"" is very floral and just a bit too overwhelming for my olfactory tastes. If strong florals affect your allergies then avoid. However, if you like flowery, perfume-like scents then this candle is a great option. It's strong enough to infuse an entire floor so you'll get plenty of use out of the large size."
4,2018-03-09,"In this urban dwelling we enjoy the glow and the scent of candles almost every evening, so I couldn't resist this aptly named Yankee Candle Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose jumbo candle. Right out of the package the scent was almost overwhelming – still pleasant – yet probably too strong for an entire evening's entertainment. As it turned out, the burning candle provided a softly gentle scent that's just right. Amazon Vine offers products from brand-new and long-established companies; Yankee Candle is one of the old-timers. I've deducted a star because the Apricot Rose glass candle container was broken upon arrival. I have no way of knowing whether or not that's a 1 in 1,000 occurrence; If it's routine, the company needs to explore better packaging, especially since neither UPS and USPS handle much of anything carefully. I understand that's the main reason for Amazon using sooooo much cardboard."
4,2018-03-17,"This is a nice sized scented candle in ""Color Me Happy.""  The smell is floral and tropical, and if you keep this on for about 30 minutes until a nice pool of liquid wax forms, it provides a lightly fragrant, but pleasant background scent for a small room.  I like that this candle is in a glass jar w a heavy glass lid, so I don't have to worry about the candle fire getting out of bounds. When I want to turn off the candle, i just replace the top so the oxygen gets used up- the top also keeps the smoke in the jar and not in my room. This is a lot of candle, and should last a very long time. The large size with one wick, however, means that you really need to keep this lit for some amount of time each time you use it, so your liquid wax melts all the way to the edges of the jar. This way, you won't get a deeper and deeper center well occurring over time."
5,2019-01-11,"I absolutely love this candle, I’m excited I’ll be receiving one every month. I wished they had the pink sand wax melts that are available every month I would sign up for those as well. My house smells amazing"
1,2022-03-17,"I got a cinnamon scented candle to keep in the bathroom (you know why…). It was great until I started to notice a thin layer of dark powder on my counter, the toilet, the outside of my tub and on my toiletries. I thought “what the heck?” and then cleaned it up. Several days later I noticed the same thing and came to realize it was soot. It had to be from the candle, as that is the only thing burned the the bathroom. I came to realize that not only it the candle leaving soot in my bathroom, but also lead in the air. Throwing this candle away. I think Yankee Candles used to be the best, but no longer. I’m switching to cleaner burning ones!"
4,2018-04-04,I found the aroma to be pleasant and subtle and not overwhelming or artificial. The wick is robust and maintains the flame well. The size is very generous and should be long lasting. The robust glass container makes it much safer than freestanding candles and preserves the moisture of the wax and the scent when not in use. The heavy glass lid also extinguishes the flame when you need to safely wrap up it's use. A little pricy but as in all things you get what you pay for. Makes a very nice and hefty gift. Comes in a well protected and very secure box as well.
3,2018-03-14,"As is often the case, but not always, this candle has a good fragrance before it is lit. It is like, possibly floral, but if you asked me to just guess a name, I wouldn't have guessed Early Spring anything. Then I lit it and let it burn for about an hour. I couldn't tell anything was happening for the first 15 minutes, nothing smelled different about the air, so I left the room for the next half an hour. When I walked back into the dining room where I had set it up, I could smell the same fragrance that I got from the candle before lighting it, but less intense.  Some Yankee Candles do have a stronger scent, I've been pleased with several of the chocolate line and some of the woodsy varieties but this one just didn't meet my expectations.On the up side, the shape of the jar makes it very stable so it relatively safe to use, using fire is never completely safe! It let within about 15 seconds of applying flame to the single wink. It barely used up any of the wax during the hour that I tested it out. The light it put out was a good amount, certainly enough to see around our 6-person dining room table without other light."
4,2018-03-09,"My daughter-in-law likes Yankee Candles.  I got this for her.  It has a pretty spring color in pastel.The scent has a musk overtone with vanilla and mix of floral.Now scent is subjective regarding taste.  I've never been a fan of musk, so I probably wouldn't buy this candle for myself.  But if you like musk and vanilla with a floral background, this may be a 5-star candle for you.We've been happy with Yankee Candles in the past.  They last a decent amount of time - this one lasts 110-115 hours says Yankee Candle.  The jar container is classic and goes with most decor.  The price seems reasonable compared to other candles.Yes, so if you like musk and vanilla, enjoy!"
5,2019-10-31,Makes my livingroom and kitchen smell great. Strong enough to notice but not over powering so I use it during parties.
5,2018-03-05,"Yankee Candles are very good quality candles. I already had a Christmas one that I love. The wildflower candle is green and has significantly more color than it appears to have in the photo. The scent is very strong and flowery, so this is for folks who don't mind--and actually enjoy--scented items. When not burning the candles, if you remove the lid, they can still scent a room. The candles are extremely well-packed and should be stored upright, especially in a hot climate. Do follow the instructions on the sticker on the bottom of the candle to get the best results."
1,2019-12-01,"I hate to leave bad reviews, but it's just necessary on this one. I bought the large jar of ""Pink Sands"" on sale for $10 I believe.I love the Pink Sands scent. I've been using the air fresheners in my van for the past 2 years. I love opening the car door on a hot summer day, and that sweet scent greeting my nose.Obviously, when I saw this sale, I thought it was a great deal for such a large candle.However, it was NOT.The candle has a single wick, which use to be adequate in the past with Yankee Candles. They were known for their potency and longevity. You USE to be able to light one of these babies for an hour, and at least half the house would smell delicious for 4 times as long.Not anymore.I don't know who purchased this company, or what ingredients they are skimping on, but they are just NOT THE SAME.You light the candle, and can't even smell it more than 10 inches away! Doesn't even work in a tiny bathroom. There's definitely zero longevity. The scent doesn't permeate the air and travel to the next room, or linger for hours. This candle is no better than an unscented decorative candle from the dollar tree yet costs so much more.Don't buy this is a gift. Don't buy this ever, for any reason.These candles should be ashamed to wear the badge & branding that their ""much much better"" ancestors wore."
5,2018-04-02,Yankee Candle is sort of a known quantity.  You get a quality candle with a good burn life that provides a pretty strong scent.  These scent on this candle is sort of soapy; a very clean and fresh scent.
5,2018-04-10,Finally I found a candle that strong and strength but not overpowering. This candle literally smells like roses. I definitely recommend this candle to any candle lovers and I will be purchasing again♥️
4,2018-03-21,"You never go too far wrong with Yankee Candles.  They burn well and evenly, and this big jar is enough candle to last many, many hours.  I've burned it for about 10 hours so far, and it barely seems to have gone down at all!  It's so easy to put the top on and set it aside when it's done---no need for candle holders or the like.The scent is nice, but I would not say it screams out Early Spring.  It's kind of a generic floral scent---not bad, but not particularly noteworthy.  I've had Yankee Candles with a lot more interesting scents.  To me, early spring would be hyacinths and lilacs and the earthy scent of new grass, but this is more just a undefinable floral.I do love how any candle with almost any scent really freshens a room, and I like the color and picture on this one, so I'm happy!"
5,2019-07-22,Gave this to my mom as a thank you gift for helping us out. Almost smells like bubble gum. But I love the scent and so does my mom.
5,2012-12-22,"I love this scent.  It's the only scent I've ever purchased in candles, sprays, car fresheners, etc...  The plug ins are quite good too.  This scent is so nice.  It's a clean, sweet, almost sugary scent.  I don't find it particularly beachy, but maybe it smells like a tropical flower or a fun beach drink.  :-)"
3,2018-03-11,"Early Spring Scent. See attached photo for scale (photo is of large jar size).  This is a large candle with a floral scent.  The odor does not carry much when lit.  This surprised me as I assumed that a more expensive candle such as this one would have more scent.  I followed the directions I found online to burn for one hour for every inch in diameter of the candle.  I burned it for 4 hours to liquify the entire layer of wax and prevent what they called “memory ring” which causes the candle not to burn completely in following burns.  I did not find the scent to travel more than about a foot from the candle even with a complete liquid pool at the top.They also recommend a max 4 hour burn time, then a 2 hour cooling time, then trimming the wick afterwards.  I find this a bit problematic as this candle has only one wick, so takes a long time to melt all the way to the sides but the time limit is then 4 hours.Burning in a glass jar does seem safer as the flame is contained.  It does burn evenly."
5,2018-03-19,"The moment I opened the box and showed my wife what was inside the box from Amazon, she burst into a big smile, opened the lid took a deep breath and left it sitting out on the end of the bar in our kitchen.  The aroma is pleasing and works well either lit or not.Yankee candles have a reputation for burning well and this one has a great fragrance.  We lit it yesterday for the first time and we were not disappointed.  It burns slowly and evenly.This single-wick candle will have a long and happy life at our place."
5,2021-07-12,This is one of my favorite scents. I feel like I am at the beach when it is lit. Yankee candle never disappoints.
5,2020-12-24,Smells AMAZING. Yankee always has the best candles ever.
4,2019-03-23,"There is just something about this smell that makes me feel happy. It is just relaxing. It was very strong when I first got it but it's definitely mellowed out some as I've gotten used to the smell. Smells of course are very subjective but for me this is one I really like.As always, having owned dozens of jar candles and I can tell you this from experience, the drawback with these is you have to be very diligent about keeping the wick trimmed or you end up with soot on your walls/ceiling. Be sure to not ignore that caveat.So, yeah, I really like this smell and this candle is the quality you'd expect from Yankee Candle."
4,2020-11-22,"I expected this to smell like a rose scented perfume or like a Catholic church (if you know, you know). It actually smells like a literal rose plant. The name says it all ""fresh cut roses"". So if you really really like the smell of the actual plant, you will like this candle.Apart from me not liking the scent, it also made me sneeze a lot! I had to blow it out midday. I will just gift it to someone. I don't want it. Good thing I bought it on prime day."
4,2018-03-05,"Yankee Candles tend to be first rate when it comes to quality, so rating any individual scent is purely subjective. That being said, my wife and I really enjoy the ""Sweet Nothings"" scent. I was initially worried that they might overdo the ""sweet"" and I'd end up with the scent of cotton candy, but that's definitely not the case. There's a nice blend of fragrance notes - not too sweet or perfumey and certainly not cloying - and the overall scent is very pleasant but quite light (perhaps the ""nothing"" in the name?). Let me be clear - the scent spreads across a lot of space (and made our kitchen smell nice after a full morning of cooking), but it's a light scent.Your nose and mileage may vary, but we really like ""Sweet Nothings."""
5,2018-03-09,"nice light scent, not overpowering,  from Yankee candle.  I've always liked their brand as the candles burn cleanly.  The candle came very well packaged, so no worries about ordering online."
5,2022-03-16,Great gift idea for the candle enthusiast.
5,2018-04-02,Yankee Candle is sort of a known quantity.  You get a quality candle with a good burn life that provides a pretty strong scent.  These scent on this candle is sort of sugary and powdery.
5,2018-03-18,Very nice clean scent and well packaged to arrive in great shape.  I have issues with heavily scented candles and room fresheners and this one is a light fragrance and very soothing.
5,2019-07-20,I’ve always loved yankee candle. Super glad I got this! Affordable and lasts much longer than other brands.
3,2014-08-26,"This is not one of their best candles.  It smells only slightly like fresh cut grass and there is a bit of a sharp chemical undertone to it and it’s a little jarring.  If the scent was more “grass” and a little less Lysol it would be worth 4-stars.As I wrote in another review, we've tried different brands of fragrance candles and none of them even come close to the Yankee Candles. They are long lasting and fragrant - the scent is even and continuous right down to the bottom of the candle. Other cheaper brands don't last ¼ the time or have ¼ the scent and actually turn out to be more expensive than a Yankee Candle because of this."
5,2020-11-14,Smells good
3,2022-07-23,I read reviews to get a general idea of how people like these products. So I decided I would take time to write reviews since I find them helpful. I like Yankee candles and this color pink is beautiful. I have spent so much money on candles trying to find scents that are strong enough that I can smell in my small apartment. This candle I can hardly smell at all. I put it in my small apartment bathroom and waited a while and went in to see if I could smell something and it's just very faint. It's a shame I will use it but I won't buy it again. I will keep reviewing some of these candles I bought lately.
4,2018-03-04,"I like Yankee Candle and the products they offer. This is the classic large jar with a new scent, Wildflower Blooms. It is a very subtle scent, and does not fill a room like some of the stronger scents do. But its soft and gives a faint spring smell to your room. Burn time is about 110-150 hours, so it would give you somewhere between 5 and 7 days of continuous burning, to give you an idea. And those are probably good estimates. I have a few of their other products, but typically I like the classic jar candle."
5,2018-10-20,Of all the candle scents available this is my favorite. It permeates well through the whole downstairs of the house. Is it a light and easy to store.
5,2020-02-05,Purchased as a Christmas gift 🎁The recipient and friends love the scent
5,2019-04-19,Love yankee candles was looking for a candle which I can add to my subscribe and save and found this one at a great price.
5,2011-02-28,I absolutely LOVE this candle.  The previous reviewer who said that this is a more subtle scent is right.  It is more subtle than a lot of the other Yankee Candles.  That's one of the reasons I love it though.  Several people have asked me what my apartment smells like because they always notice a pleasant scent but can never figure out what it is.  I keep a Lavender Vanilla candle in my bedroom and living room with the lids off and burn them just a couple times a week for a hour or so.  That is all it takes to make this soft scent linger.  I have never had any trouble with the way these candles burn so maybe the other reviewer who did just had some bad luck with the one they purchased.
3,2021-03-16,Ok. These are well known candles. I really like this scent but it's not very strong. Maybe in a bedroom or certainly a bath but not in a large room. I bought it because the one I REALLY like is twice as much. It's fine and I'm not trying to complain. I still think these candles should have a better price point. It takes longer to get the scent than I would prefer but if you like just burning candles for hours you should like it. I would think it would be giftable based on the brand.
5,2020-10-08,Fragrance is spot on! Gift
4,2018-03-18,"I had to go look up the top note on this scent because it was very strong and sweet for me and didn't smell like the floral sweetness of jasmine. It turned out to be mandarin leaf.It's lightly sweet and the patchouli is a very, very light bottom note. I had to work to smell it and my family didn't notice it all. The musk reminds me of the kind of musk perfumes that were popular in the 90s, warm, subtle and nuanced.I like it- and nobody in my family objected to the scent. The throw on the candle was good without being overpowering."
5,2019-09-05,Wonderful smell and carries in the house.One of my favorites (Salted Carmel is another)
5,2020-02-28,This is one of the strongest scents in my opinion. Very nice
5,2019-12-13,"I love the scent of this candle very much! It reminds me of spring and it makes the entire room smell. My candle arrived in perfect shape. Not broken. However, it would be better if they bubble wrapped them instead of the paper box they are put in so others don’t receive theirs broken!"

5,2019-04-15,My favorite scent for all time! The smell when it melts is just relaxing delivers me to hang out in Malibu!

5,2017-01-23,I love Yankee candles. I've tried several brands and these don't have that waxy smell to them when you burn them. Lilac Blossom is probably my favorite scent. They might cost a little more but to me it's worth it.

5,2018-04-15,This has a lovely sweet/fruity scent - very Summer-like.  It burns cleanly and always has a lovely smell.
