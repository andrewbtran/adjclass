5,2017-08-27,"If you're a fan of vanilla cakes, ice creams, and puddings, your mouth WILL be watering from this unbelievable, orgasmic scent which fills several rooms.  It's so good I often hesitate to light the candle, knowing that it's going to TORTURE me with its delicious smell.  I think once this candle has been used up, I will definitely buy another one.  This candle alone has earned Yankee Candle a customer for life."
5,2018-09-30,"Great scent that lingers hours after the candle has burnt out. Smells of caramel, brown sugar, freshly baked pastries, rich grain.Yankee Candles tend to be very hit-or-miss in my experience, and when spending so much on a candle it's important to get the right one. I've tried dozens of Yankee Candles and Salted Caramel is one of the top two or three I've experienced and one of the few I've bought more than once. Highly recommended."
5,2019-08-25,"If you like a cinnamon scent with a hint of apple thrown in, then you'll love this candle.  I light this candle and leave it lit all day.  It last a long time. Seller provided fast shipping, I recommend this candle."
1,2019-03-05,"I don’t know why Yankee Candles chose to dramatically reduce, or at times eliminate the scent in their candles. They were reknown for consistently strong scents, that wafted throughout your home, but no longer. I purchased 20 for gifts last Christmas, and no aroma at all could be smelled in 11 of them. Too late to buy other gifts or return them. I had them wrapped and distributed. I still feel guilty. Many Companies risk quality when mass produced for Amazon.I’ll never buy another, anywhere. Without vigilent quality control batch testing, a manufacturer often goes bankrupt. Amazon must educate and inspect quality measures consistently, lest they sale garbage. However, as long as it sells, they could care less."
2,2019-01-18,"I usually have good experience with Yankee Candles.  But 2 of the 3 I bought on Amazon were duds.  Both Sparkling Cinnamon candles only burned about 50% of the wax before the wicks were spent.  I always trimmed the wicks per the instructions on the bottom, but one of them sooted really badly and neither burned properly. On the first, about 1.5 inches from the bottom, the wick burned out because it was folded over and didn't go to the bottom of the candle.  The other one burned with such a low flame that it burned a hole down into the wax without melting half of it.  I've never had this problem with Yankee Candles purchased at a local brick and mortar store for $20+.  Perhaps these $13 units on Amazon are factory rejects?On a positive note, they smelled good.  Just wish I would have gotten them to burn thoroughly.I don't think I'll be buying any more of these off of Amazon."
5,2018-08-24,"Yankee candles are hit or miss for me but this one is a winner.  It smells like a warm creme brûlée, even when it's unlit.  I went out to run errands this afternoon and left the candle uncovered on my kitchen counter.  When I came back an hour later I walked in and immediately smelled this sweet lusciousness.  I thought my husband had lit the candle, but no, it's just so richly scented.  I'm going to order a couple more in case it's discontinued."
5,2020-01-26,"I love,love,love this candle!!! It does not have a good odor, it has an amazing😊😘😊😘one!!! It has a scent just as you'd think cinnamon should smell. My neighbors smoke 🚬 24/7 and it makes me nauseated. I've asked them to please turn on their exhaust, but they don't all time, which I think is rude.  Lighting the one wick (I wish they were two wicks. You know, to make it a stronger strength against the cigarette 🚬. The other Yankee candle has two wicks...the one that goes straight all the way up and doesn't curve inward at the top), but just lighting this candle helps against the cigarette 🚬 smell. I hope this will help you as well!If this review helps you please press the ""helpful"" below I below. I do not get any free or discounted items. I just like to know that I've helped my fellow women and men. Thanks!"
5,2018-09-21,I love this French vanilla Yankee candle.  I look forward to lighting it every time I walk in my door.  It has a very comforting scent and you can smell it throughout my house.  A definite must buy!  Very happy customer!
5,2021-07-02,"I've been a Yankee Candle addict for well over 15 years, and this scent, ""Home Sweet Home,"" is the only one I use year-round!This purchase was delivered a day early and is a REAL Yankee Candle, not fake (believe me, I would know immediately if they were).People have asked me why I always buy the Yankee Candle brand? Because they're more expensive than others. I explain to them that I have bought other ""knockoffs"" to save money before, only to end up getting exactly what I paid for...wasted wax without any scent at the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the jar 😒, so they didn't save me anything.I don't work for the company, but I am a stickler for being well informed, so I know why the Yankee Candles cost more than their competitors... See, other companies only use their scented wax at the top 3/4 or 1/2 of their candle products, the bottom is just colored wax with a hint of scent. This way, they are able to trick the average customer into buying them. Don't get me wrong, at first, they all have great ""throw,"" however, as they burn down, their scent becomes much weaker. Some brands don't even use wicks long enough for their candles, causing them to fizzle out long before they should.Yankee Candle Company uses fully scented wax throughout the entire candle. They also have a high concentration of scented oils, to insure a strong throw of scent, from the first time you light it until it burns all the way down.*** P. S. Make sure you buy the REAL THING, not a cheap knockoff. I noticed that the complaints here are all about the ""Cinnamon Sparkle"" scent. Even though they're listed under the ""Home Sweet Home"" one. I ordered 2 of the ""Home Sweet Home"" scent here, and they're real Yankee Candle brand. If you get a fake one, like some of the other customers, report it to Amazon immediately! Amazon is just a distributor. They'll accept a return, even if your candle is burned to the wick, refund your money, then investigate to persecute the dirty posers!***"
1,2018-12-16,"I don’t think this is a real yankee candle. The wax was filled all the way to the top covering the wicks, making it unusable unless i’m able to scrape the wax away. Further, i noticed that it did not come with a proper Yankee Candle lid.  I attached photos of a real yankee candle next to the one i purchased."
5,2021-11-29,"This scent is one of the best of the yankee line.. has a smell of comfort, home and sweetness. I don’t like food scents. This is a perfect combination of dried lavender with a hint of oak. Favorite!!!"
5,2018-04-06,"Unlit, this candle smells like salted caramel. Lit, it smells like someone cooking hot pancakes with syrup. I can’t explain it — but my whole family loooooves the smell! Will buy again."
5,2021-07-21,Do you want your house to smell like creme Brule?? This would be the perfect candle for you then! This candle (in my opinion) puts any vanilla scented candle to shame and those use to be my favorite ones to light!
1,2017-11-26,Buyer beware!!!! Bad bad product!!!! No scent....none not even a whiff...second time this has occurred. Obviously Yankee Candle has instituted a cost reduction by not including the scents in this candle.And since I used part of it Amazon has no means for getting a refund!!!!!
5,2021-01-22,"I hate it but I have to give it 5 stars because my mom likes it and it does what it promises. My entire house smells like the inside of a box of Red Hots candies. Other people complain about there being no scent, so maybe there is some sort of issue with consistency in these candles, but let me tell you, the one I have has my house absolutely reeking of spicy cinnamon. I dont really like the smell but the price was so cheap that I gave it a shot thinking 'it's probably not that strong of a smell'. Man was I wrong. So if you like the smell of Red Hots, give this a try, hopefully you dont get a dud like other people are complaining about."
1,2017-11-10,"I wanted to love this candle, I really did especially since vanilla cupcake is my favorite scent. But this candle literally has no scent even when I sniff it right out of the jar I barely smell it. I can burn all day and it won't even smell in my bedroom. I wanted to love it especially since it's a large candle, but I'll stick to my Bath and Body Works candles."
5,2021-03-22,"It's worth the effort to always see what Amazon Warehouse has in stock before you buy your item. I've gotten in the habit of doing this when I'm looking for a Yankee Candle. I found a Spiced Pumpkin large jar candle just a couple of days ago that was reduced to $13.39. So I decided to give it a shot. All of my past experiences have been good and this one was no exception! It arrived 1 full day early & it was very carefully packed. Upon opening, the jar was in excellent condition. Everything about the candle is authentic Yankee quality. However, when I removed the glass lid I saw that the wick was slightly singed, yet none of the wax surrounding it had been melted. Sort of like it had been lit and immediately blown out. It wasn't intended to be a gift; but if it was it wasn't giftable, so I rated it only 1 star for that category. I lit my candle and in a few seconds, no one was the wiser, lol... This candle currently costs $24.97 brand new on Amazon. I can live with the savings of $11.58, though. It pays to check the Amazon Warehouse from time to time!"
5,2022-08-11,"I READ SOMEWHERE THAT FLYS HATE THE SMELL OF CINNAMON SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THESE A TRY.  IT TAKES AWHILE FOR THE AROMA TO PERMEATE THE AIR SINCE I AM USING THEM OUTSIDE, BUT ONCE THE SCENT, WHICH IS NICE AND NOT TOO OVERPOWERING, GETS INTO THE SPACE IT DOES SEEM TO MOSTLY KEEP THE FLYS, FLEAS AND MISQUITOS AWAY. WE HAVE ONE BY OUR STOCKTANK POOL AND WE SIT IT CLOSEBY ON THE SURROUNDING DECK AND IT HAS CUT THE NUMBER OF LITTLE BUGS THAT GET INTO THE WATER SIGNIFICANTLY! OUTSIDE ON THE DECK I USE A COUPLE CANDLES NEAR WHERE WE EAT AND IT DEFINITELY HAS HELPED."
5,2021-02-27,"I was expecting a ""slightly damaged"" product, as that's how this Yankee Candle was listed when I purchased it. It was a French Vanilla large jar candle, reduced in price from Amazon Warehouse. I figured that for the discounted price, I could deal with that. My candle arrived today, a couple of days early, which was nice. When I opened the box and inspected the contents, it was in pristine condition! The box and the protective enclosure inside was a little damaged, but that was it. So, I'm a happy camper with this purchase! I've purchased a couple of things through the warehouse and have never been disappointed, so I make it a habit to always check the warehouse before I make my purchase. Who doesn't like to save a few dollars ever now and then? As always, my Yankee Candle is highly fragranced, and I know I'm going to get good, quality burn time as well. 5 stars from me!"
5,2021-08-18,"Great scent if you love birthday cake. Unfortunately everyone goes nose blind to scents after a while of being in the vicinity of a scent and after those few first glorious minutes of being in a room with this candle lit, you won't even notice the smell.That is ... until you walk out the room to so something (whether to go to the kitchen, bathroom, etc) and return to the room. Then the soothing smell of fresh birthday cake returns for a few minutes.Nose blindness is no fault of the candle. Just our stupid noses 😠Anyways I used this candle beyond what was recommended and had no issues. Do so at your own risk but I did use the candle until all the wax was nearly completely burned out. I've lit, put out, and relit this candle multiple times with no issue.So long as the bottom of the glass isn't getting hot there shouldn't be a risk of the candle and glass exploding. But then again, what do I know? Do so at your own risk but I just could not allow myself to stop using this candle once the wax reached below half. It smelled too good to waste.Also this candle is very aesthetically pleasing in a room. It blends in and the fire burning inside the glass jar just looks elegant.I recommend this candle wholeheartedly and will likely try a new scent from this company too."
5,2020-09-30,"This Yankee Candle smells amazing! It smells like a variety of warm spices and it has a hint of sweetness to it. It's not your typical fall scent so it can be used all year long, but it still puts me in the holiday spirit. I noticed it filled my entire bedroom with fragrance within only 20 minutes, which isn't typical for Yankee Candle nowadays. A lot of Yankee Candles are hit and miss in recent years with issues such as tunneling and no throw, but this candle was a hit! It's melting to the edges and smells lovely. This candle might have put my faith back in the brand."
5,2020-08-13,"I like to burn candles in my apartment because I find that freshening sprays don't always last as long as I would like, and incense is just too strong and invasive for me to want to use it consistently. Yankee's salted caramel scent is probably my favorite one so far.It is extremely sweet-smelling as you would expect, but it is not sickeningly sweet like I was worried it would be. It almost reminds me of bread baking or fresh cookies. It is a very warm and soothing smell that I would not necessarily describe as subtle because it will definitely fill up a room, but it is not overpowering and becomes part of the scenery.I got the Bahama Breeze scent along with this, and while I like that one, the scent is not nearly as strong as this one and is much less noticeable. I would be cautious of giving this as a gift to someone because I could see some thinking it is overly sweet. I don't think it is, but I like sweet scents so I may have a higher tolerance than some people. On the same token, I definitely recommend trying this for yourself, it's definitely a treat and will make you feel cozy the whole time it's burning."
1,2018-11-27,"I read reviews of this and another version where apparently neither candle has much if any scent at all. So I ordered both versions to test them before sending them as gifts to others and it's true, essentially no scent. You might as well just buy a red candle, or alternatively pay more for one that is worth it."
5,2019-08-09,"With the closure of the Yankee Candle stores, I've struggled to find new Yankee Candle scents I like...it's hard to ""guess"" what something will smell like.  I found this candle at TJ Maxx (or something like that) and loved it, but, of course, when I went back to find more, they didn't have any.  This is why I love Amazon...if you know what you want, you can bet someone is selling it!!  Anyway, I love this warm scent...not too overpowering, but definitely a spicy vanilla smell...like you baked something fabulous!"
1,2017-12-28,i bought 3 of these for a christmas present for my girlfriend. there is NO smell at all when burning them.this is her favorite candle so we know the difference.there is a 2 month wait for a replacement which i find unacceptable .  i'm not sure if these are defective or a fake item.very disappointed.
5,2021-10-22,"I was never really a ""candle person"" until my next door neighbor's cigarette smoke started to waif over to our side of our townhouse.  Enter Yankee Candle... One of my favorite flavors and aromas is vanilla, so of course I ordered two Vanilla Cupcake candles to not only enjoy but to try and combat the lovely flavor with the pungent odor of cigarette smoke.  It worked so I keep them burning all day, up until I go to bed for the night.  Yankee Candle is one of a kind and burns just right.  Don't get fooled with imposter candles, which I won't mention their names out here.... Just stay with Yankee and you won't go wrong!!"
5,2021-03-04,"I love Yankee candles and the next order I made for village candles was a huge mistake! The pics looked so much like Yankee that I accidentally ordered 4 of the ""look a likes "" just received them yesterday and what a let down.  Nothing like Yankee and I've tried to burn 2 of the 4 I ordered and absolutely no scent at all!  I was misled by the fact that I thought it was Yankee, but they are not worth ever spending money on if you're hoping for some scent.  Just wicks burning without any scent.  I will be more careful in the future and I only made the mistake since I noticed that the bottle looked exactly like Yankee.  Too bad I ordered 4 of them! I wouldn't even ever give as a gift since they are junk.Sorry to be so honest and blunt.  I'll most likely go to the local Yankee shop at the mall for future candles since I use them quite a bit"
5,2022-02-02,"First of all, I shouldn’t have even bought this candle because I’m on a diet. Lol idk what I was thinking but just to tell you how good this candle smells my husband thought I baked a cake when he walked in from work and was extremely disappointed to find out it was this candle. This scent is strong, and it last even after burning it. I’m trying to find more to buy because wow! I’m a candle-holic because I burn through candles soooo fast. But I feel like it’s actually going to take me a while to get through this. Worth the money For sure!"
5,2020-10-27,"I don’t always write a review for my orders, but after reading the reviews from previous purchasers I felt I should. My candle arrived today and it’s amazing!!! I am so pleased! With Covid, going to Yankee Candle just isn’t going to happen. Took a chance and I am so happy I did! It’s just what my home needs this fall. If I am going to continue to be stuck at home, damn sure it is going to need to smell good!! I have a husband and animals, they don’t smell good. My candle is my Covid hero!"
5,2021-03-01,"I don’t like food smell. I have an open concept kitchen and living room. So when I cook something smelly like roasted garlic or fried fish, the smell gets all over the place. This candle is magic! I light it up and in five minutes my kitchen smells amazing. Even my husband noticed the smell and enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it."
5,2021-08-03,"I love Yankee candles. The second most bought candle I ever buy. Only because they are expensive, but they are so worth it. They really last a long time and will permeate the room if you burn them long enough. I accidentally left a pumpkin one burning for two days in the back of our house. That room smelled lovely for weeks and weeks.If you get yours and the packaging has residue all over it, just wash the candle and lid off and it's fine. I don't know how it happened, but I don't mind.I really only was concerned about the cats so I put the box away from them."
5,2021-02-27,The scent from this candle is unbelievably warm and long lasting. The fragrance smells like the real thing not chemically made.The jar and lid are heavy duty even surviving a fall from a desk.  The wick is thick and lights up immediately and does not turn off unless I turn it off.The fragrance extends outside my home but is not over bearing or “fake” smelling.It’s been used for over 20 hours and it is 2/3 finished. Will buy again.
5,2016-12-27,"I love this smell... Smells just like creamy strawberry ice cream. Even just taking the lid off the jar makes me happy. Might be my favorite scent ever. I do like sweet smells (not everyone does). My favorites tend to be cupcake scents, flavors with the word icing in the title, vanillas ... Some people don't like sweet scents. If you do tend to like the sweet ones though definitely check this one out! It's different but amazing <3!"
5,2021-08-17,"Perfect for those that have a sweet tooth but appreciate less calories. This candle last a long time and it smells heavenly. Your home will smell like you’ve baked and you can skip the calories. Hey, you never know…you might be dessert.😉"
5,2021-08-09,"Yankee Candle has got it right! Triple boxed to protect their product and your purchase. These are great candles and I have buying them for years. They last a long time (of course depending on how long you burn them). I highly recommend Yankee Candle!Of course for the ladies: nice mellow fragrance, suttle glow for those romantic evenings. You'll look beautiful bathed in its flickering light.Gents: if you don't have one of these for those romantic evenings you came unprepared."
5,2020-11-28,"Due to COVID restrictions, I was unable to obtain a yahrtzeit candle on time for the anniversary of my mothers death. This seemed like a hefty candle and was deliverable in-time, so I went for it with the hopes that it would be large enough to burn in her memory for the length of the day.I was quite overjoyed when the candle burned for three days straight, and it smelled wonderful too. It may not have been a yahrtzeit, but I felt at peace nonetheless."
5,2020-08-14,This is one of my favorite selling candles from Yankee. The smell is wonderful and the candle last a long time. The price was a lot cheaper than at the Yankees store.
5,2018-12-10,This candle smells delightful.  The cinnamon scent is very pleasant. It's not too strong and the candle Burns for a long time. I burn it in my bedroom during the day and when I walk in the room it smells great!  This cinnamon is very warming and reminds me of home  During Christmas when I was growing up.
5,2022-02-15,"The smell is amazing. It smells like someone is baking a delectable dessert. While I’m a good cook, baking is not a talent I possess so this is a good substitute. The candle lasts forever, I’ve been burning it nearly every night for a couple weeks now."
5,2021-12-31,"One of our all time favorite Yankee scents. Warm cozy Vanilla scent with good throw.I highly recommend this candle as well as the use of a Yankee Candle Illuma ring lid with these candles it helps them burn so much cleaner and using every drop let's you enjoy it that much longer! The Illuma lids are both pretty and functional, and can be purchased very reasonably during Yankees clearance sales. Enjoy!"
5,2021-04-07,"This is what i think a house should smell like during the holidays. Its a very light, comforting smell. I use it when i have people over and its the 1st thing the mention coming in the door- smells like home. Its hard to decide the smell beyond that. Makes me think of spice cake and cinnamon, apple pie, and xmas. Hands down my fav scent from Yankee."
5,2021-09-17,"Well, I gots a stink problem in me home. I farts a lot, and they doesn’t smell good. But this here candle by Yankee smells good! In fact smells so good that you wants to eat it! It turns me stinky fart house into a lovely smelling vanilla bakery! I ain’t kidding neither! So I gots to recommend this here candle as must have! I’m ah hoping this company comes out with a fried pie scent, for me that’s the best scent you could have."
5,2016-01-07,"We frequently have a Yankee Candle lit in the kitchen and this Apple Pumpkin candle is my favorite winter scent. It has a nice warm spicy and rich scent that makes the kitchen smell like something really good just came out of the oven.The candle burns cleanly and evenly when I use an 
  
Illuma-Lid Jar Topper







  
  
     and trim the wick to 1/8” after every burning. The Illuma-Lid is more than decorative – it helps keep heat inside the jar and prevents “tunneling” where the wick burns down through the center of the candle.Yankee Candles are a bargain. I used to buy inexpensive jar candles of uneven quality that didn’t last very long and frequently lost their scents.  In comparison, Yankee Candles always keep their scent, burn evenly, and last a very long time. They may cost a little more, but turn out to be much more economical in the long run."
5,2021-10-04,"The product is fantastic! The problem is Bezos taking his cut which don't leave much meat on the bone for the seller, and I think that's BULLSHlT!! I sincerely hope, from the bottom of my heart that Jeff and the Sanchez live forever! Again, fantastic product! Great seller! Thank you very much."
5,2022-06-17,This great smelling candle was one of my best purchases ever. It does make your whole living room smell great. It last longer then any other candle so far. I love the price.
5,2021-02-14,"I've been a big fan of Yankee Candles for many years. Vanilla cupcake is one of my favorite scents. If I baked, this is what my house would smell like. It definitely fills the room with a yummy vanilla aroma.Several years ago, I learned from a Yankee Candle store employee that the multi wick candles give off a stronger aroma than the single wick candles, so this is the only style of candle I'll buy.It arrived well packaged to guard against damage."
5,2022-07-20,This candle was a great buy.  I have been a Yankee Candle devotee since I got my first candle from a boyfriend!  What a great present!  I presented this candle to myself and my Mother.  We love it when the room smells great!  Any one who comes visiting remarks about the fragrance!  Thank you for offering this item!
5,2021-12-28,One of my candles were defective.  It was melted and the top seal was cracked.  I have never had this issue before and I have bought numerous Yankee candles from Amazon.  The other candle I bought with the same order was fine.
1,2020-02-15,"Wow, was I ever disappointed in this Yankee candle.  I use to buy these all the time and the scent was delightful and lasted throughout the entire burning of the candle.  This candle had NO scent at the beginning.  It wasn't until the last inch of the candle that any scent was noticeable and even then it was very faint.  I bought two different fragrances in this purchase and both acted the same.  Won't be spending the money on Yankee anymore.  Plenty of other candles out there that are way superior to Yankee these days.  Sorry.  Do not recommend Yankee candles."
5,2021-01-11,"This apple-cinnamon scent actually permeates a large room, which I've found a little unusual for this brand.  This scent is crisp, reminiscent of fall and Thanksgiving.  Like all their large jar candles, it burns a for a long time.The wick creates a lot of smoke, though, and their prices have skyrocketed.  Fancy jars and colors don't make a good candle.  Good scent, longevity, and quality wicks do.  Not to mention, these include paraffin."
5,2020-09-22,"I live in a 3-floor townhouse and within 5 minutes of this candle being lit, the house is filled with smell from this candle. Although it is salted caramel, I actually think it smells closer to maple syrup. My guests think I have been cooking pancakes all day (which nobody has ever complained about). In addition, the longevity of the candle is fantastic. I have had it lit for over 10 hours and it is not even 1/4th of the way burned out. Excited to continue lighting this all Fall!"
5,2020-02-03,"Lasted us about 2 weeks. We had it in the living area of our home, which was a big space to cover (kitchen/dining/family room all in one open area). Scent was noticed and helped give a nice warm vibe. It didn't fill the whole house with the nice sweet scent, but the large common area was smelling tasty! We are new to candles, so we are not sure if 2 weeks is average lasting time for this size of candle, but we did burn it daily and for a majority of the day. Either way we loved it enough to buy another one (different scent, same size, same brand)!"
5,2020-11-11,"I know, I know. Yankee Candles have a high price tag. But you get what you pay for, and I have to say, this candle makes my house smell like the baking gods have smiled upon me. I've been lighting it every night for hours, and it's not even half gone after a month.Being trapped in my house through this pandemic is tough, but getting to smell this candle makes it slightly better. Yankee Candle, if you're reading this, feel free to send me more."
5,2020-12-14,"The only brand I buy or gift. I burn it all the time.  Care and Longevity Hint: For the first burning only use for an hour.  After that snip the top of wick before lighting everytime. This will help keep the candle burning evenly. If it has two wicks as this candle does, make sure when you snip that the wicks are the same size. They always melt evenly with no wax build up on sides and no crater where the wicks are located. Love these Candles!"
5,2017-10-22,"Smells amazing! There's just something about this particular candle that just makes you want to light it up, and curl up on the couch with a warm cup of cocoa or tea! It really is great! Despite all the other customers having issues with cracked glass or a melted candle, I had no issues with mine. The packaging was perfect--a lot of packing air bags were included so that it wouldnt break! I also think the fact that some people received melted candles were probably because they ordered them during periods in which the weather might have been a lot hotter--so i definitely recommend buying these candles from Amazon when the weather has cooled down a bit."
5,2021-03-23,"Apple Pumpkin is my very favorite harvest time scent for October and November. All the scents of the season in this one, great throw without being overpowering. The candle is a beautiful color that blends perfectly with my fall decor. Yankee Candle did a great job on Apple Pumpkin!"
5,2020-12-05,"Yankee Candles are the best I have found, except for Illuminations, but I don’t think they’re in business any more. Kitchen Spice is the perfect scent for the holidays. But... Amazon said this candle wouldn’t be available until January, so I left it in my cart and ordered one from Yankee Candle - at almost twice the price. Still waiting for that one to arrive."
5,2020-12-09,"I like the candle, but my last one has lasted many years. I am using this one the same amount, and I don't expect it will last more than 2 years.I bought another candle this year because I do like the scent, but UPS delivered it, unfortunately. They claimed they left the package ""at the gate."" I do not have a gate. They dropped it in the dirt at the bottom of my driveway where I almost ran over it with my car. Unacceptable!"
5,2019-06-28,"The Yankee Candle Lg. Jar VANILLA CUPCAKE is my favorite scent. Every time you walk into the room you smell a true Vanilla scent. I promise you'll love this one!Trim the wick before lighting & it'll last right to the bottom of the jar. Lasts with nightly burning in our living room for weeks too.Look at my pic & you'll see how it glows in a dim room. It's comfy scent, if you know what I mean! Great gift to give too!UPDATE- This is the 3rd Vanilla Cupcake scent we've bought thru Amazon & ALL have been top quality. It's burned every day, just trim wick before lighting up."
5,2020-04-07,"Nice candle, but I was just looking for a different kind of vanilla scent. I think I was looking for the Christmas Cookie candle but bought this one instead. Says cupcake, but this one is more of a cheap store bought cupcake lol. It doesn’t necessarily smell bad, it just isn’t the kind of vanilla I like. PROS — burns for a long time without giving you a headache after awhile like some candles do. Pretty big and only has one wick, so it’ll definitely last a while. Better suited for bigger open areas like a living room or dining room because the fragrance could be a bit too strong for a small space like a bedroom or bathroom. CON — none really. Just wasn’t the scent for me. Wouldn’t be fair to give a bad review for my own purchase mistake."
5,2022-08-10,"I am in love with this candle. It’s super earthy and calming. I’ve been through 3 of them so far and will most likely be getting another eventually. The scent really permeates unlike some of the other Yankee Candle scents. The only downside for this candle would be the price, but you can almost always hunt down a sale."
5,2021-04-02,"Wrapped the way it should have been but something ripped in transit, it looks like, no fault of the seller. I also love the fragrance. But the very best was this candle was a decent price for Yankee Candle. Most are getting out of hand.. I went to cheaper candles lately and saw this and grabbed it right away. Thank you for the quick delivery also. I am pleased and would recommend."
5,2022-06-02,"I bought the Home Sweet Home.Candle burnt perfectly. The scent did scent ,but really weak for this candle.However,the half inch in the bottom of the burnt candle is SUPER scented.I'll use it in a wax melter and it will do well.Its as if the scent went to the bottom.  Strange."
5,2022-01-08,"I have bought this exact candle at Yankee Candle store and it smelled great. Buying this on Amazon, the best way I can describe the smell is paint thinner. I decided to go to Yankee to make sure my scenes weren't off and it smelled like it should have. Never buying candles unless its from the store."
5,2020-11-05,"I went to a friends house and while I was there I said ""what are you baking?"" and she's like ""absolutely nothing!"" I asked why her house smelt like chocolate and she showed me this candle. Not even joking it smell's exactly fresh baked brownies/chocolate cake! I immediately found the candle on amazon and bought one for myself and for my mother. Just as a warning, the smell is so fantastic you'll seriously want to bake something chocolate. :)"
5,2022-01-12,"I've had other flavor candles that hardly produce a scent. This one.... WOW! A few minutes after lighting it, you can already notice the sweet scent of Chocolate Cake! Amazingly, hours after turning it off, you can still notice the scent! Big Bang for the buck! No disappointments here!"
5,2022-08-19,I bought this candle for my mother-in-law as a gift because she's basically my second mother. She loved this scent so much and I saw it on here and had to buy it. I honestly love the smell as well. I suggest buying this candle bc the scent is so beautiful and can make your entire room smell beautiful while it's lit.
5,2020-05-26,"Salted Caramel is my go to scent in fall, winter and even early spring. This scent is not a flora, nothing against floral,  but has warm, yummy, deep caramel/coffee scent but not too sweet.  Large candle has long burn time and scent fills the foyer, kitchen and great room without being over powering.Please don't stop making this scent, it's a winner. I also purchased the SC melts, can't get enough of this scent. Will go beachy/floral in summer."
5,2021-01-10,"We purchase scented candles to make our home feel more cozy.  At this time, we aren’t sharing many indoor spaces with others, so feeling comfortable is most important.  The candle scents will vary during the year.  This one reflects baking on a cold winter day and anticipated enjoyment of time with our friends and family so come."
5,2021-07-22,It makes my house smell like I've been baking all day! The candle has a good burn time
5,2021-04-10,"I'm on a diet and I love chocolate.  This makes me happy (without the calories) and makes me smile each time I light it.  Though it smells just like warm chocolate, it doesn't make me crave chocolate so that's kind of perfect. I light my candle before I settle in to read in the evening and it smells so good the whole time it's lit.  I'm very happy!"
5,2019-07-15,"I used to think Yankee Candles were for my mom's generation. There's such a huge following of Yankee products and I am definitely not in their general buying demographic. That being said, I have bought boutique candles from multiple places and I have yet to find a candle that rivals any scent, longevity and price of Yankee Candles. These candles last me weeks and I light candles on daily basis since I work from home. Buyers tip- Try to find these at 15 to 20 bucks on amazon! I never have bought them from more."
5,2022-02-21,This scent is my new favorite. It smells like an expresso with vanilla and nutmeg added! I have bought one for my living room and bedroom. The scent just makes my home me welcome. Guests that have come to my home remark on how much they like the scent!!
5,2016-12-25,"I searched all over the web for a chocolate candle for my husband that was made by a popular brand that I bought him years ago. Come to find out, it was discontinued so I decided to give this one a try. I am so happy I did because he likes this scent even better! You can't go wrong with yankee candles!"
5,2021-12-18,I have been looking for a nice fall scent and this was perfect. I burn a lot of candles. I am very pleased with yankee candles. They have gone up in price that was a bit of a surprise. But I guess like everything else. You can’t go wrong with this brand of candle.
5,2019-11-21,"This candle is very strong, but I love it. The smell can linger in the room for a couple days after burning. I can always depend on this scent. It tends to last a little while and I leave it burning for hours. *The one I purchased here did come covered in wax residue and was separating from the glass. I ran it under hot water and scrubbed it off with a sink sponge. Not that big of a deal, but thought to be noted."
5,2020-02-05,"At first I thought that the smell wasn't long-lasting, but my the first thing my husband said when he got home yesterday was ""It smells really good in here, it smells like donuts"". Then I showed him the candle and he said that the smell was coming from it. The best thing is that the candle was in a different room when he first smelled it. So, it smells amazing, it really lingers, and I got a very fast shipping. Thanks Amazon and Yankee Candle!"
5,2022-04-01,"Scent is amazing, yet not overpowering"
5,2016-01-24,"This is a great scent at a great price. The Cinnamon Vanilla scent is much stronger and fills more square footage, but this scent is very nice. It smells like mulling spice (spices and orange essence) with a subtle pumpkin undertone. If you like the smell of pumpkin but do not like to be overwhelmed by it or get hungry from simply smelling a candle, then this is the candle for you! Honestly, you cannot beat the price for this large of a candle. I will order this again as long as the price stays the same. If the price gets higher, I will switch back to Cinnamon Vanilla."
5,2022-03-09,"I actually bought this as a gift for my younger sister and she loves it. She kept telling me how sweet and relaxing the scent was. I personally love Vanilla scent but this Vanilla Crème Brulee is my favorite Vanilla scent. I recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet but not overpowering, relaxing and enticing scent."
5,2020-09-11,"I was disappointed when it came and was smashed, but contacted seller and they are replacing immediately.  I bought my daughter one and hers was fine. Several are writing about the lack of fragrance, but mine is great and strong and I can smell throughout my house."
5,2014-09-30,"Just had this delivered, & could not wait to light it. I LOVE Yankee Candles! I always order the three same ones. Home Sweet Home for use all year. Harvest for fall, & Mistletoe for Christmas.  I have tried many brands of candles, & will not burn anything or buy anything but Yankee Candles. I LOVE that I can light the 22-Ounce jar, & it is enough to make our entire house smell wonderful, I also like that it helps to add to the charm of the holidays. I am very happy with this seller, & will order from them again. I think if you order Yankee Candle you will be hooked as well. They are a bit pricey compares to other brands, but well worth the money."
5,2018-02-13,I purchase about 5 of these per week for both of my houses. This scent is my favourite and it comes in an authentic yankee candle box. These large jars last me about 7 days and I leave them burning 24/7. Love them and this is a great discount. I save almost $100 a week buying from amazon va the yankee store.
5,2019-11-11,This is perfect for the holiday season!
5,2022-01-11,It’s not overpoweringly sweet or spicy. It’s just right and reminds me of my Aunt baking with cloves and mixing cinnamon and brown sugar for sticky buns around the holidays. Like I said it’s not too sweet. It’s just right.
5,2018-01-31,The scent is so strong and these candles last so long. I never Knew what the fuss was about until i got A yankee candle for Christmas. It was a Christmas scent so i burned It everyday trying to get rid of it and it lasted until the end of January. I just Lit this candle about half an hour ago and the smell is already filling my house. It smells like a bakery in my house! I will Never buy another brand again and this scent will probably be ordered again and again!
5,2015-01-09,"Always been a cheap candle guy, then one day I was feeling like a big shot. ""Go big or go home"" I said, and I got 2 yankee candles. They outlasted my cheap-o candles many times over, and smelled better the whole time. Works out that they sent just a better value, they are a better smell too.  Apple pumpkin is a great option if you like apple spice and pumpkin pie, and if you don't enjoy those things, than you have bigger problems than can be solved with a candle purchase on Amazon."
5,2020-10-30,"I'm not usually a Yankee Candle customer, because they are a bit pricey... but this was on sale, half off - so I said YAY! The scent is nice and it burns for a long time... though you can't really smell the candle when you step away from it... I love a candle you can actually smell... but, for the price, it was a good buy!"
5,2018-01-22,"Just like cologne, I don't buy it online because of the obvious---the scent! However, this product had awesome reviews and I figured I'd help out. This arrived in perfect condition and on time. The scent fills up the room perfectly. I have a turtle tank in my room so not only did a candle help with a little bit of light but also scented up the room nicely. It's not too strong either, it's a greta gift idea for someone who likes simply home products or actually needs an odor blocker for whatever reason, but doesn't want to use chemicals to do it."
5,2022-02-01,"This scent fills my entire downstairs area!!! I will definitely be purchasing more of this scent. It has a strong scent but not too strong. For anyone that loves vanilla, this scent is a must have!!!"
5,2019-12-15,This is my favorite scent for fall. It’s what I think about when I think of what fall smells like. The packaging was excellent and the price was better than what I would pay in a store. These last for a whole season for me and the smell stays constant. Yankee candles never disappoint. They burn evenly and smell strong unlike other candles that lose their smell after a few hours of burning them.
5,2022-02-19,"Do not order during summer.  I ordered 2 and when they arrived they had melted. They were on their side, so we totally non-usable.  Had to return them.  Ordered one this winter & it was great!!"
5,2022-04-09,I’m a big fan of Yankee candles as gifts and to keep for myself. I enjoy the scent and the warmth they bring to a room. This one I kept for myself and it didn’t disappoint..
5,2021-10-14,"I live overseas due to being in the military, These candles were packed very well and arrived on a timely manner.  Even tho I am thousands of miles away from home, this candle gives me a sense of being at home.  Thank you!"
5,2021-10-23,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 These candles have the best long lasting scent, always have."
5,2022-02-28,The aroma fills the room and the candle has a long burn time. Well worth the money.
5,2021-10-25,Leave it to Amazon to carry something that Walmart doesn't want to carry in their stores anymore and charges prohibitively for when ordering online... French Vanilla is the only candle scent worth buying. IMO
5,2022-03-15,"When the brand say's ""Yankee Candle"" u know you r buying quality candle. The fragrance is so intoxicating when u light it and the smell lingers on for hours. I only buy Yankee Candles"
5,2021-06-22,"Love this candle scent. Ordered two, one was packed carefully in corrugated cardboard. However, the other was bubble-wrapped and came broken. It's more of a bother to return it, but we'll probably by these from Yankee Candle from now on."
5,2020-11-27,"I am not a candle person but ordered this as a gift and it's very nicely packaged.  I opened it to see how it smells and it is nice for a salted caramel candle.  I don't have much to add as I won't be the user, but it seems like a typical nicer jar candle and I know the recipient will enjoy it."
5,2021-02-24,"I love yankee candles and vanilla cupcake is my favorite. When I received my package, I had ordered 5 candles and they all arrived in the same box. I opened 1 and found it had melted severely but I tried with a candle lighter to melt it back down. It made a mess and turned the wax black. My momma said I should send it back. If if was just that one I would have let it slide. So I checked the other 4. I found 2 more the same way. These candles are not cheap and should not arrive in such a shape as they did. I would like them to either be replaced or refund me my money. Thank you."
5,2021-11-13,"One of my favorite scented candles. Smells like cinnamon , sugar and coziness."
5,2021-04-17,"This was amazing. When I opened my mailbox, the scent wafted it out towards me powerfully. Unfortunately, the candle jar had cracked. They sent me a new one immediately. And the smell is one of the best and most powerful out of all candles I have ever burnt."
5,2019-01-12,"I love this scent from Yankee candle. I tried to buy it on the yankee site and they were sold out. I thought I'd try Amazon in case they had some left in stock and they did!!! Great price on it too. Yankee candles are rather expensive, though.  So happy I was able to find this one. My mother in law had bought me two large tumblers for Christmas,  but the bag broke and so did the candles on Christmas morning lol. So sad. Now I have a replacement"
5,2021-01-26,SPARKLING CINNAMONAbsolutely a must buy.  The wonderful cinnamon aroma scent flows throughout your home.  If you like the smell of cinnamon then this is a must to buy.  It is long lasting and it makes a GREAT Gift.  I give this Yankee candle a five-star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ rating.
5,2020-11-20,"The spiced pumpkin candle smells great, really helps put me in the mood for the holidays.  It arrived on time and in great condition.  I burned it in my family room and within 5-10 minutes the smell had really moved into the entire room and into our adjacent kitchen.  Happy with this scent."
5,2021-12-26,I love two wick yankee candle they just put the sent in the room twice as fast. The price is great. I refuse to pay the going price. I'd live without. I love spice sent at Christmas and actually all year. I also love cinnamon and the lilac. Smell like the real thing.
5,2019-03-08,"Keep in mind that when I purchased this candle it was about $13. I noticed that the price changes a lot. To me this candle is not worth $24. However smelled great and it lasted at least 3 months of moderate to heavy use. Really a warming, vanilla cakey, yummy smell. Loved it!"
5,2020-10-22,"Good throw, nice scent. I don't like ""good"" smelling scents, my fall favs are McIntosh then harvest. I added this one in the mix this year &I really liked it.  Yankee has a lot more door than it used to but the accents are still true so I'm a fan over other brands. And they last a long time!"
5,2022-02-24,The scent of this candle is delicious! I love the smell of anything salted caramel and this exceeded my expectations! It has terrific longevity and leaves your house smelling so good! I will be purchasing this again as it was a total hit!
5,2021-06-16,"I love yankee candles! The only problem I have with them, is that they smoke a lot. My ceiling has black smoke stains from them. Otherwise, this sent it wonderful! Fills the whole room with the wonderful aroma! Just wish it was smokeless."
5,2019-08-01,"I have bought Yankee candles on sale from emails they send and they invariably gave almost no scent when I receive them, so they don't end up being a bargain at all.  I have received two of these salted caramel scented candles from Amazon so far (subscribe and save) and they retain their strong scent until the candle is burned away.  Make the whole house fragrant. Highly recommend."
5,2020-12-19,I bought the salted caramel candle and it was so amazing! The scent filled my large living room and kitchen. Smells so delicious! And it lasts forever! I honestly light this candle almost everyday for hours while I read or watch TV and it has lasted months! Definitely buying another one!
5,2019-11-28,"I always heard that Yankee Candles are expensive, but when I caught this on sale I wanted to find out for myself. I own a rather large home that is on one level. I lit the candle on one end of my house and the sweet fragrance permeated throughout my house. I'll continue to purchase Yankee Candles as long I find the best deals. No store bought candles can compare."
5,2022-01-19,"Yankee is always reliably good, so what made this extra-good was having my favorite Christmas ""holiday scent"" at such a big discount DURING the holidays.  I enjoyed keeping one and gifting one.  Such a deal!"
5,2018-10-23,I've been buying this for over ten years every autumn. Harvest always seems to sell out and for good reason. This has a beautiful fall scent without overdoing it on the cinnamon or vanilla. I'd liken it to pumpkin spice but not a food like scent at at all. It burns evenly and forever if you use one of those metal toppers for jar candles. Would buy again..and again..and agin.
5,2022-03-09,Maybe the best smelling candle I have ever used.  The scent is strong and lingers long after it’s blown out.  Well worth the money. I could not be more content.
5,2021-07-27,This one smells great and I like the design on the glass
5,2018-10-11,"So far so good. I wanted a fall candle for the season. I got one from a known placethat wasn't yankee candle (it was pumpkin scented) and it didn't have much scent at all. I saw this on Amazon and not only does it burn even, but it has a nice cinnamon 'apple pie baking in the oven' scent. It's not weak and it's just right. Also it's a generous size. I'll be using it for many seasons to come.Yankee candles always seem to be of good quality and scent. This one smells natural and not artificial like some apple scented candles on the market."
5,2020-09-05,This has got to be one of the best Yankee Candles. I think it is our 4th or 5th of the same scent. Very strong. I will say someone who did not have Prime ordered one as a gift one time and it arrived melted (Christmas in Texas). But I have not had any issues with it melting when ordered with Prime.
5,2022-07-16,This candle smells incredible. Usually I’m not too fond of artificial vanilla or “baked goods” fragrances but this one is just perfect. Also it doesn’t seem to trigger my migraines like most other candles!! 10/10 will continue to purchase.
5,2022-03-15,I bought this for my Aunt's birthday.  She called to let me know that she loved the scent.  The Vanilla Cupcake scent and Yankee candle did not disappoint.
5,2021-01-20,"Loved this candle! The scent is fantastic if you want your house to smell like cinnamon, which I do. It lasted along time as well. Matter of fact, this would be a great gift for your candle lover as well. I would buy this again and again."
5,2020-11-19,"This fall fragrance quickly became a new favorite for my daughter and me from the 1st time we lit it!  It is a perfect mix of the apple notes with pumpkin and permeates our house the entire time while the candle burns, albeit 1 hour or 4 hours! I've now ordered 10 as gifts for family and friends!"
5,2019-03-19,"While the scent is actually salted caramel when I lit this lovely candle, I can’t help but be reminded of freah pancakes and maple syrup. It’s a strong scent and filled my living room and kitchen with its aroma. I am a big Yankee Candle fan and this was a new scent that I will purchase again!"
5,2022-03-22,I really liked how securely it was wrapped for shipping. It came in perfect condition and it is legitimately Yankee Buttercream and not a knockoff.
5,2017-04-07,I love this fragrance. It is one of the best I have ever experienced  (my favorite is clove and cinnamon but there is nothing available in this scent). Thus I ordered another jar.  I notice that there are some complaints about the vendor but people should say who the vendor is.  I have purchased mine directly from Amazon and I will post more once it arrives in the mail.PS ..Oct 25 2017  I just purchased a second one. In a sentence it  has a nice scent at a nice price.
5,2021-09-25,"As a yankee myself their is no other candle like a Yankee Candle.Everyone try..Home for the holidays my sister buys me one every year,I will buy one for my entrance  for the holidsys....Go Yankees"
5,2021-06-08,This was bought for my mother and she loves it. Only problem is she loves the way it smells without being burned and she doesn’t want to burn it. Will be buying again so she can use the one she has and have another after the first one is gone.
5,2018-12-17,"OMG this smells amazing! My husband walked in and asked me what I was baking! Sorry dude, candle for dessert tonight. It smells sweet but not overpowering, like fresh baked cookies. It does a good job filling the space of our large downstairs area with food smells and the wax lasts a long time. Good value and makes a great gift. I’ll be ordering again so I can pretend the store bought cookies are homemade. Lol"
5,2022-04-18,Salted caramel is my favorite scent and Yankee has discontinued it!! Bought this for under $20. Smells just like I bought it out of the store
5,2022-04-09,"If there was a #10 for scent, I would award it! These are my favorite candles, ever! They burn evenly, last a long time and smell amazing!"
5,2020-04-12,"When I first saw this I was like, that’s so expensive, however; after I used it for several hours it barely melted and smelled great. I use it almost daily, for several hours and several months now and it’s still over halfway full. Other candles might last a week! I love it! Lasting so long a smells wonderful!"
5,2022-02-15,"This is my favorite scented candle! The scent reminds me of Christmas and it has such a pleasant, welcoming aroma.  Cheaper than buying from Yankee!!"
5,2019-10-02,"Smells like chocolate tootsierolls candy! Not bad but I was expecting a more cocao scent instead. Came very well packaged. My husband enjoys the scent, it smells like burning chocolate to him. Next time I’ll go for the cafe candle scent instead to see if it’s better. I love confection smelling candles since it reminds me of being in a bakery shop."
5,2022-08-06,"It, indeed, smells like vanilla. Potent enough to notice, not so much that you feel like you're walking into a wall of scent."
5,2022-04-01,These cinnamon candles seem to leave some wax on the inside of the glass compared to other candles that burn completely.  Smell great.
5,2022-05-15,"Great candle, love the vanilla cupcake scent! It’s strong but not over powering and I’ve gotten tons of burn hours from it."
5,2018-10-26,"Delivered quickly. Smells great in my office. Easy to light and easy to put the top back on to extinguish.I managed to drop one a few inches onto a carpeted floor. It broke into pieces above the candle portion. Had to toss it. The glass is very thin, so now I know."
5,2020-10-27,"Neither best scents ever!  And that don’t fade?The Walmart brand candles may be cheaper, but they burn up in a day.  Plus Walmart sells Yankee candles for $20. On Amazon I can get them for $14.99 to $16.99!!Yankee candles are the: Elon Musk version of candles of FOREVER.  Best customer service!"

 This is honestly my favorite scent from Yankee candle it smells like vanilla but is not over whelming or fake smelling. I had this scent for my car and I am happy to now how this scent for my house to smell. Honestly if you into vanilla I recommend this scent."
5,2020-09-10,"Bought this for myself and my mom for her birthday. She is a “vanilla” snob, as it is her favorite scent. She loves this candle! I am burning this candle daily, all day and am on day 5 and still have 1/2 the candle left to burn. These last way longer than the big box stores!"
5,2022-04-02,"This smells wonderful!  I bought 2 different candles and they both smell fantastic!  Very strong (but not overpowering) scent.  Packaging was great, no breakage."
5,2021-07-28,Yankee Candle is my favorite.  They last a long time and the scent last all the way to the last drop of wax.  A lot of candles start smelling like wax.  Not these.  And so many great scents.
5,2021-06-08,Best candle ever

 I love the smell and it burns oh so long I will buy more"
5,2022-02-05,Smelled like cupcakes fresh out of the oven.. had it placed in my kitchen.. was so fragrant I could still smell it in my bedroom down the hall!
5,2018-10-05,"That classic Yankee Candle French Vanilla. Can’t go wrong. I like to light this one during early Fall in one room, in addition to an apple scent burning in my kitchen. The mixed smells make it extra cozy, especially on those drizzly days."
5,2021-10-22,I buy Yankee candles every year for family and friends so much so that they now count on receiving them!!! Great for hiding orders or bringing a beautiful scent to your home.
5,2022-05-15,"I love strong scented candles. this is a good candle for the winter, the warm spice smell just reminds me of winter time."
5,2022-02-26,"Great candle! I keep a Yankee candle in my kitchen to remove smells of grilled, fried, sautéed foods! It’s perfect to burn to freshen up the smell of your house!❤️❤️❤️"
5,2022-01-31,"This was a gift for a sick friend. It was perfect. A nice cheery color and a scent that just fills the room. Just look out, it'll make you hungry"
5,2020-06-23,The salted caramel scent smells amazing! It smells just like what you expect. The scent smells up my whole apartment and will hit you at soon as you walk through the door. It also has longevity instead of the 3-wick candles I use to buy a B&BW that wouldn’t last no time. This candle does!
5,2020-12-16,"This candle has a great scent & vibrant color. The only thing I don't like is when you burn past 50% the upper part of the jar turns black from lower wax level. They should use wider, shorter jars to eliminate it. Otherwise, nice candle!"
5,2022-02-19,The smell ... Smells exactly like chocolate... One of the best candles I have purchased.. just a little bit bigger would have been better.
5,2022-07-26,"Smells great, and Yankee candles always burn well and last a long time.  Very happy with this one!"
5,2019-12-07,Yankee Candles are so nice. The scent of each on is so unique and last so long. The do start off strong and then die down. They stay the same from the moment you first light one until the very last flicker of the wick.They are true to their scent from candle to candle as well. This is a very good line of candles
5,2020-11-22,"The smell is absolutely delicious.  Definitely made the house feel like fall.  I would have lit this year-round, but I had it lit almost non-stop and was used up pretty fast.  Didn't give me any headaches/migraines.  No allergy reactions."
5,2018-11-21,"You walk into the house and there is a gentle fragrance (not overpowering) that fills the air.  We utilize the fireplace in the winter, have a hairy dog, and normal household cooking smells -- this candle takes care of all your concerns about any odors.  The only candle we buy!"
5,2020-11-28,Great customer service.  Instantly!  I’ll buy my candles from them from here on out.  Customer service is sometimes more important than the product.  But they also sell YANKEE CANDLES!  My fav!  Thanks for helping me with my questions and concerns. You put my worries to rest
5,2020-11-13,"This jar candle has a great smell. It lasts a long time, and you can smell it through the house. I am so glad I bought this jar candle. I usually don’t like many jar candles this one is great. I highly recommend this scented jar candle"
5,2018-08-31,"This candle is great! I love Yankee Candles and this one is one of my favorites but was unavailable on their site so i was so excited when i found it on Amazon. It is delightful and i have already started using it. I had given up on ever being able to have one in this fragrance and then lo and behold I found it...it just proves what I tell friends...""if it exists Amazon will have it on their site! """
5,2021-07-13,"I have bought several yankee candles over the years and have always had pleasant scents, not overwhelming,  and the are clean burning.  Yankee candle gives you  a quality product"
5,2021-08-12,I just wanted a good smelling candle and that is what I got!
5,2021-09-24,"This is a great candle. The smell  penetrates the whole house. When people walk in, they think I’ve been baking a chocolate cake. It makes me hungry sometimes."
5,2021-09-09,I've loved Yankee Candles for many years and they haven't changed. I only wish they had the scents I liked before. Since COVID its been hard to find a lot of them.
5,2021-11-02,Not sure why it don't smell st all when lit but sure has a lot of black smoke coming from it.my other on is perfect not sure why this one's not smelling.
5,2022-08-16,I love the smell of this candle and it last long too! This product is definitely worth it
5,2017-10-30,"I love this scent! Yankee Candle is more expensive than other brands but I think it burns longer and has a scent that will fill a room. Unfortunately, Yankee Candle doesn't sell this scent any longer - Amanzon is the only place I've been able to find it.  Also, it is now a single wick instead of two which means a wax  ring is left after the wick is gone.  But if you want a scent that isn't too sweet or too spicy - this is the best!"
5,2022-03-11,My sister loves this because it's good at over powering the smell of smoke. You would never know she smokes in the house.
5,2020-03-08,"My boyfriend's favorite scent is Vanilla, I buy him this candle every year for Christmas like clockwork. You can definitely smell the vanilla without it being too overpowering. I love this brand and prefer it among all others although  I love the fruity scents more. Will definitely be buying again!"
5,2021-12-11,"The candle came perfectly fine and packaged. Smells great and always lasts me a fair while, in fact this is my second time buying it.  (I got the vanilla sent)"
5,2021-01-05,"Sparkling Cinnamon is my new favorite scent! (I'm not sure what's up with the sparkling because nothing is actually sparkling.)It smells like ""sweet"" cinnamon... As if I lit a bunch of red hot candies as a candle."
5,2022-01-06,There is no scent anymore. I having been buying yankee candles for 40 yrs and the last two have little scent. I have not had covid
5,2021-05-14,The scent is fantastic. Love the candle to give as a gift. Durable. Great value for the money.
5,2018-09-24,"Have been buying Yankee Candles for years and this is by far my favorite, especially for the fall & winter season's. Not too sweet and the right blend of spices aroma. I only live less than an hour away from the main plant in Deerfield and enjoy the ride however, when Amazon had these for around half price I jumped on it. Using it right now. Perfect. Thanks Amazon and Yankee Candle :-)"
5,2022-05-03,"I love Yankee candles, no complaints. I would order again and gift! Just ordered for Mother's day!"
5,2021-12-18,"Pretty candle for Christmas - festive, burns evenly (maybe too well!), my wife likes the scent.  She dislikes the green balsam variety!"
5,2022-04-08,"The scent is very, very, light.  Compared to it's competition, this one gets a very, very, light review."
5,2022-01-08,This is great for keeping your bathroom smelling great especially when there are no windows! Would like to see this offered in a  larger jar !
5,2022-01-31,Used to get hot coco and cream from b&bw 's  but this year they did not have a good one so tried this one am now on my fifth one and just ordered again
5,2021-12-19,I have been buying back candles. I put them in my SPA shop. I bought them at a discount for only eight dollars. I like the taste.
5,2020-02-03,I got such a great value for one of my all time  favorite scents and the smell and color are so perfect for February. The hint of cinnamon is amazing. Kind of spicy scent. It’s very easy on the nose. It’s beautiful while burning. I’m so glad I found the LARGE jar at an amazing price.
5,2020-10-15,I love the smell but did not burn right the wick ran out and was left with a little under half the candle not burnt... Waste of money
5,2020-12-17,This candle smelled more fiery than anything which I like.  Sent the wrong style.  Bought single wick jar and received double wick.  I decided to keep and glad I did.  Single wicks don't burn nor throw well IMHO.
5,2022-04-13,"Love Yankee candles, but they're always borderline too expensive.  $18-$20 is too much, in my opinion."
5,2020-01-26,"This candle is very fragrant! I love the cinnamon scent! My house smells wonderful!  I noticed the warning label on the bottom and if you are going to buy a good candle, it should be able to be burned all the way down or most of the way down.  It was kind of pricey and I did not know about the warning until I received it.  Other than that, it has a long-lasting fragrance and would make a great gift!"
5,2020-11-10,Great candle. Smells great and these last forever! My only issue was in shipping it seems to have melted and made a mess on the packaging but Amazon was quick to replace it! No issue otherwise! Smells like a chocolate cake!
5,2018-01-23,"Not only is this scent great, it also will fill the room.  Lots of times I can't smell the candle once I'm more than 5 feet away from it.  That's not the case here, this candle will fill my whole apartment with it's scent; but it's subtle and not overpowered."
5,2018-09-07,"Smells wonderful and doesn't smoke (as long as I don't let the wick get too long. I use these almost every day in my living room, around the year, using scents appropriate and desirable for the season. This brand of candle is the brand I have settled on because it I've always been pleased with the scent and the wick burns down appropriatly so the candle doesn't burn out on it's own."
5,2022-08-14,Love it  Been burning it for hours a couple times  The smell is very strong
5,2022-08-09,Smells good I put it in the kitchen family room area smells good burns nicely
5,2013-06-06,"I've always loved this product and other scents from this company.  But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents.  Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles.  So, if I would have stayed with what I knew, I wouldn't have had to pay to have my walls cleaned and wasted money on a cheaper product.  ""You get what you pay for"" rings loudly for me.  Thanks for the excellent product."
5,2018-09-05,"In the past, I was never a fan of caramel scented candles, however, my wife changed my mind recently when she began burning one.  After enjoying that candle, I decided to order my own for my office (work from home) to burn.  I have not been disappointed one bit with the Salted Caramel.  It is a pleasant scent and one that makes me at times crave a little caramel (heh, go figure)."
5,2022-03-21,I love the candle.  The scent is wonderful.  The candle lasts a really long time but never long enough.  My only small complaint is the wax build up on the sides.
5,2021-11-15,"Classic Yankee candle. Great scent and quite a long burn time, as advertised. I see no reason to buy another candle brand"
5,2020-12-22,Just in time for xmas!!! It smells amazing and has 2 wicks..My grdgirls said it smells like red hot candies!!!i t does!!itIt was used every day for 4wks and will last another 4 come xmas next yr
5,2020-01-07,"I have been a Yankee Candle fan for many, many years.  I've loved Pumpkin Pie and Home Sweet Home, but this Kitchen Spice is now my most favorite.  It is just a wonderful smell with cinnamon and other spices.  I also love that amazon has it for a good price, less than in the stores.  Keep this in mind if you are looking for that perfect candle."
5,2021-02-26,Smells exactly like chocolate cake! We love this and order whenever we can find it. Why I’m the world would they retire this scent? It’s a must have and perfect for every season and occasion.
5,2019-05-21,"I purchased the French Vanilla, Salted Caramel & the Chocolate Layer Cake.  All smell great but the Chocolate Layer Cake makes me want to eat.  It smells like a delicious cake baking.  First time purchasing Yankee Candles & I have to admit, they are the best."
5,2013-06-06,"I've always loved this product and other scents from this company.  But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents.

Thanks for the excellent product."
5,2022-02-18,"Love my Yankee Candles.  If Yankee not running any specials, Amazon best place to purchase.  Most scents are good."
5,2022-01-30,"I have loved Yankee Candle for decades. Kitchen Spice is such a great, soothing scent and fills the house with warmth."
5,2020-11-01,"This candle is one of my favorites from Yankee Candle. It smells fantastic and fills up the house with a great scent. It's also not too ""spicy"" scented like many other spice candles, it's just a perfect scent for Fall."
5,2022-02-03,Yankee Candle never disappoints… home has  the most beautiful smell … fairly strong  scent but not overpowering
5,2021-08-22,I have no problem with that candle!
5,2020-05-05,"Candle came right on time! It smells amazing, by far one of the best smelling candles Yankee Candle has to offer. I would recommend this to any yankee candle lovers. This is the 3rd one I’ve ordered just this past year! Will be buying again for sure!!"
5,2020-08-15,"I love vanilla, sugar cookie, frosting etc. smelling candles and this candle takes the cake (no pun intended)! It smells decadent—i could smell the sugary vanilla goodness through the box before I opened it! Would definitely recommend!"
5,2019-06-22,"I have tried several of the different sweet Yankee candles (cafe, cookie, cupcake etc). This one is the BEST. It is strong and the scent lasts longer than other candles. If your into the smell of cookies/baked goods - you will love this one.  I burn it at work and it lasts weeks, even burning it all day. Lovely!"
5,2022-03-27,I kept this candle for myself and I was glad I did. It burned well and had a lovely vanilla scent.
5,2022-01-06,Such a good warming smell not too strong but enough to make you feel like you’re in a warm cabin with some baked goods baking it doesn’t make you hungry either!
5,2021-08-03,"Arrived on time, undamaged. Smells amazing and for the price..cant go wrong."
5,2020-02-13,"I received this as a gift just before Christmas and I’m so grateful. This had our house smelling like apple pie and holidays. When I was a kid my mother loved apple scented candles and would have them in every room, so this is very special to me. I’ve already bought more."
5,2021-12-24,Smells great!  One of my favorite Yankee Candle scents.  Smells exactly like salted caramels smell while cooking!
5,2022-06-10,"After reading all the negative press about Yankee Candles, I decided to see for myself.  This candle is lightly scented but very pleasant.  I will order again."
5,2022-07-14,Great that's what! Yankee simply makes the greatest candles ever!!
5,2018-04-20,"Great, medium strong scent. If you like vanilla scent this is for you. Will cover a large living room and then some if burned a while. I later bought the two wick model, which prevents loss of wax by ""tunneling."" A quality product and well worth it. You can even open the lid and put in a closet to make things smell good!"
5,2022-06-19,A very good smelling candle. I don’t like most scents but this one is fine.
5,2021-02-19,Buying this product for a gift for someone who loves this scent and was so upset to find that it was being discontinued. Thrilled to find it here on Amazon. I can't wait to see the surprise when its opened.
5,2017-06-29,"I love Yankee Candles. I was introduced from a nieghbor with Apple Caramel Cake & I was sold. Its non like other candles, it axually leaves your home smelling exactly like the candle says. Im so happy with this product, im going to purchase a different one every time."
5,2021-10-07,Yankee candles are always quality and consistent. The candle smells as it is named.I use it in living room near fireplace.
5,2021-09-30,I was so excited to receive my new candles at a great price.  Also the candle was packed well eliminating breakage when the box was dropped.
5,2020-06-15,This was an awesome price for a YANKEE candle. It is one of my favorite scents too. It burns nice and smells amazing. Sort of like a cinnamon smell but not too strong. I love it.
5,2019-01-05,"Love YANKEE candles.. And there cheaper on AMAZON Yayy.. I bought the large size HOME SWEET HOME & KITCHEN SPICE.. These r a couple of my favorite flavors.. So amazing, and Strong, but not like your eating it/tasting it, if u had that happen b4 w/other candle brands & or flavors."
5,2021-03-02,"Large Candle, but sadly does not put out a strong scent. This brand is cheaper on Amazon than retailers. The flame starts out strong but struggles to stay lit, the more you use it."
5,2021-06-28,Love the wonderful chocolate scent. It smells wonderful. Bought as a gift for sister. Her favorite scent is chocolate. She will be very pleased.
5,2016-03-09,"Love this candle!! it had such a great scent.  It made my whole house smell like I was baking fresh apple pies in my kitchen. I never understood why people paid so much for a candle when you could go to Walmart and buy them for half the price. But after purchasing this candle I understand the price difference. There is a much more  Intense aroma with the Yankee candle. Additionally, the candle burns for way more hours than with A cheaper version. This candle just kept burning... I couldn't believe how many hours I got out of it. I am officially converted to a Yankee candle girl. The problem is they have so many great scents to choose from, that want to spend all of my money on candles now!"
5,2020-12-31,It arrived in Yankee packaging and was in perfect condition. I have only had it for a couple of days so I don't know about the longevity but it burns evenly and has a homey throw to it.
5,2021-09-03,"Smells like Mom's baking a cake! I wish Yankee Candle hadn't discontinued this scent.I would order in the colder months, just so it isn't partially melted when it arrives."
5,2020-12-08,I had no issues with this candle. I was nervous after reading other reviews stating suspicions that it was a knock-off Yankee Candle. My wicks are burning just fine and the candle has a strong scent. I love burning cinnamon candles during the holidays. Will definitely buy again.
5,2022-08-15,Nice candle. Smells wonderful. Senator is Not over powering.
5,2021-01-03,I LOVE YANKEE CANDLES!  The scent is always strong enough to fill a room and they last as stated.  Especially like the jar candle so you can snuff it out just by putting the lid back on.
5,2021-12-11,This candle smells justLike caramel! The reviews saying that it has no smell are simply wrong . The room smells like caramel two minutes after lighting. I will say that if you do not like too sweet of a smell this is not for you. Very rich and sweet scent. I love it !
2,2017-08-05,Ahh was so excited for this.. I live far from any yankee candle and they are my favorite!! Pumpkin is my number 1.... it arrived today totally melted .. figured I'd still use it bc it's a candle and it's going to get melted anyway... completely unusable  .. the wick is melted somewhere that i can't even find it.. still 2 stars bc it's the best smelling melted mess I've ever seen.. just sad I can't use it
5,2021-10-27,Enjoy Yankee candles. Scent is not overpowering. Good value considering how expensive candles area.  Makes a nice gift.
5,2021-09-23,I bought this candle because it has the scent of vanilla. I was very pleased with the scent when it arrived at my home.
5,2022-05-25,I bathe with this scent every day and it keeps my fear of death away.
5,2022-02-14,Yankee candles are awesome ! Long lasting ! Great scents !! Absolutely love these candles for personal use and for gifting !!
5,2022-07-19,This is my favorite candle company and my favorite scent. It smells like a cozy home.
5,2021-10-21,This is my favorite Yankee  candle and the price was right.  (They have gotten much too expensive at the  regular price!)
5,2020-10-17,"I was a little hesitant to purchase a scented candle without a ""sniff test"". I needn't have worried as Yankee Candle is the standard-bearer when it comes to scented candles. Very happy with the purchase."
5,2020-07-31,"First off, I received it the day after I ordered it!!! SO that was a really nice bonus surprise! The candle is exactly what I look forward to every year, about this time, as I really start to anticipate and get excited for fall. Absolutely no complaints at all! 100% satisfaction!"
5,2020-12-23,I ordered so that my 11 year old could gift it.  The shipping came at a decent time and she is happy with the product.  My child specifically asked me to write this review.  Thank You.
5,2022-06-10,This lasts a long time because it burns slowly.  Great value!
5,2021-07-02,"Very good candle not too strong not too weak just perfect smell throughout the house I was able to Catch this deal when it was $12 a jar I bought two at the time because I know the price will go up, now that when it fluctuates and price goes up to $30 I think that’s just ridiculous.."
5,2020-10-05,"GREAT SCENTED CANDLE.  YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THERE IS A STRONG SPICEY SMELL OF THE CINNAMON OR MAYBE TOO SWEET FROM THE VANILLA.  SUPRISINGLY, THEY BALANCE OUT WELL TOGETHER.  WHAT A YUMMY COMBINATION FOR A YANKEE CANDLE.  I JUST LOVE IT !"
5,2021-08-12,Yankee is the only candle I’ll buy. For myself or a gift. It’s a nice true smell. They burn even. A great value for the money.
5,2022-05-11,"Forget going to the candle store, amazon yankee candle for the win"
5,2021-11-04,I'm glad I still can find this on Amazon. I don't have a Yankee Candle store in my town anymore. I love this scent. It reminds me of Fall.
5,2022-05-03,"I love Yankee candles, no complaints. I would order again and gift!"
5,2022-04-05,"If you have never purchased a Yankee Candle before, do it!  I've bought this scent so many times!  When my sons were in their teens, they would come home to the smell of the Buttercream and get all excited that I had made cookies...not...haha, just the candle.  Love them!"
5,2022-08-08,These candles work so well and last a long time.
5,2020-04-29,"Great scent! Does not have much burn time. I was disappointed that it did not last longer burning. The scent continued each burn, the wax  just was gone quickly."
5,2022-01-09,I love these candles. I use them when I smoke. I don't like my house to smell like smoke so I light  candles when I smoke and these candles leave my home with a very decent sent.
5,2020-02-03,Love these! Come in a nice box that can be wrapped for gift. The scent is lovely and not harsh or overwhelming. It smells like a home cooked desert and great for people that don’t want something different to vanilla or cookie. Large lasts me a long time.
5,2021-01-23,"My favorite everyday scent in the Yankee Candle line. I was happy to take advantage of discounted price. Ordered two, both came in well protected and in perfect condition."
5,2021-03-26,"Yankee is one of the best brands of candles. The scent is always great and the last for weeks, even if you burn them everyday. I always buy Yankee."
5,2021-02-16,Love the wonderful scent. It's my daughter's favorite one. Highly recommend this one.
5,2020-09-09,I bought this on a whim not knowing the scent. Yankee is a fantastic brand but I’m picky about my scents. This smell is phenomenal. The perfect fall candle. I’m going to buy 10 so it lasts forever....
5,2022-01-02,"Love it and I use on my kitchen and the smell is amazing, it penetreted all over the house"
5,2019-12-02,Very large fragrant candle by Yankee Candle!  The Yankee Candle has a very alluring and realistic chocolatey cake smell. It filled my heart with the delightful scent that I once knew as a child(grandmothers chocolate cake) Highly recommend this candle for anyone who loves chocolate!
5,2021-12-10,I love this sent! I've always loved sweet vanilla sets and this one was perfect.  Burned continuously for 3 days and it was a nice clean burn to the edges all the way through. I go through candles quickly so I was very happy that this one lasted long.
5,2022-03-22,It’s a Yankee Candle….as good as you would expect of Yankee Candle
5,2018-03-10,My husband loves cinnamon scented pinecones during Christmas.  We couldn't find them this year and this was a great substitute.  Every day he came home and lighted this candle...which is really funny to me.  I can't get him to do anything that requires repetitive schedule like that.  Lasted a long time (several months) for it being lit every day for at least half a day.
5,2022-06-07,My favorite scent from my favorite company!
5,2022-08-11,The price was awsome and it smells so good
5,2022-05-01,"Each candle lasts over 120 hours. Great scent, great gift."

5,2022-05-01,Each candle lasts over 120 hours. Great scent.
5,2022-07-03,This is one of the best you can find.
5,2018-12-27,"My daughter wanted sweet smelling candles for her birthday/Christmas among other things, when she lights this candle in her room it travels throughout the house every time she comes in and out of her room, and I don’t mind it at all but in the her room it is very strong but she likes it so it’s fine I guess"
5,2021-10-13,Love this scent.  It makes the whole house smell like fall.  Yankee Candle is the only candles to buy.
5,2022-03-12,"Love Yankee brand, this candle smells so good! Love the price"
5,2022-01-25,This candle smells so good that you immediately want a fresh baked cookie.
5,2020-12-11,The scent of the vanilla cupcake is delish.  I smell mostly vanilla but that's a good thing because I really cannot say I know what cupcakes actually smell like.
5,2021-12-15,"This is the best fall scent, not overwhelming and very pleasant.  High quality candle!"
5,2021-11-03,I use it for the scent - it infuses the whole front of the house with the delicious pumpkin pie scent.
5,2021-02-21,Love the smell of this candle it’s my new favorite.
5,2022-01-05,Girlfriend loves this candle with the light cinnamon scent and homey feel
5,2022-02-23,This candle doesn’t make unhealthy fumes and the fragrance is so good.
5,2020-10-09,Packaged in a cardboard sleeve in a Yankee candle box and did not break in shipping! 😍(unlike my recent identical purchase from Walmart that came smashed)Highly recommend.
5,2021-07-28,Amazing smell! Love Yankee Candle candles as always. This vanilla smell is super great; long lasting candle too.
5,2022-03-14,Strong Lasting Fragrance.. Love my Yankee Candle also people that have visited me.
5,2020-12-11,I got this as a gift for my sons teacher who loves cupcake secent. It smells spot on. Scent is strong but not over baring. True yankee candle that we all know and love.
5,2011-04-26,"I ordered this item as a gift, so I can't relate how the candle burns or smells when burned. I've owned several Yankee candles, and I feel that THEY ARE THE BEST over all other kinds of candles -- in every way that you could imagine.  Loved the pumpkin scent...didn't seem that it would be too strong.The packaging to protect the item during shipment was extensive.  It was taped thoroughly to close the jar, and then surrounded by thick corrugated cardboard to protect it.  Then in a box with bubble wrap."
5,2022-03-31,NICE SCENT NOT OVER POWERING AND SLOW BURN TO LAST LONGER!
5,2021-03-05,Didn’t realize these candles were for “real” men. Fantastic smell that expresses just the right amount of scent into the room. Lasts a long time too!
5,2021-05-01,"I burn candles ALL THE TIME. What I like about Yankee Candles is that they are affordable, they burn clean, a and them smell delicious."
5,2020-02-24,I live in a condo next to a smoker and these candles keep my condo fresh and clean smelling.  This flavor has a bit orf cinnamon scent to it.
5,2022-04-05,My husband loves this scent. Stronger than other brands.
5,2021-12-29,"I love these and amazon keep me from having to go to the mall to get them, yay"
5,2022-04-23,"Smells good, and the lid fits nicely underneath."
5,2021-12-04,Omg I love this scent!! And it came earlier than expected. Makes a great gift.
5,2020-12-04,"A very warm & cozy scent, perfect for a Christmas or house warming present. Arrived in pristine condition, inside a genuine Yankee Candle box. Order with confidence."
5,2017-01-26,I bought this scent because I received a small salted caramel candle for Christmas and was in love with it. I was really hoping this yankee would be as fragrantly delicious and I was not let down. I will be ordering another for sure. The scent is so on point and it fills the whole second floor of my city apartment (with quite high ceilings). Do yourself a favor and buy this candle!!!
5,2014-04-10,"I bought this in memory of my 7yr old granddaughter who died in a car accident last month.  She loved strawberry ice cream and her favorite color is pink.  The scent is awesome and I end up craving strawberry ice cream every time I burn it.  I love Yankee candles and this one is my new favorite.  I'll be buying another as soon as this one is gone.  I also love the name ""Summer Scoop""-perfection!"
5,2018-09-15,This smells wonderful! I will say when it was delivered it was on a hot day. I opened the box and the candle on the top was a little melted. I was surprised I had never had that happen before. It was not sitting on the steps. Was home when it was delivered.
5,2020-11-22,The smell is absolutely delicious.  Definitely made the house feel cozy.  Didn't give me any headaches/migraines.  No allergy reactions.  Even my boyfriend loved this!
5,2021-03-02,"This is literally the best please all candle. Have never had any complaints. Price was fine. It was nice that it was shipped directly to my door. That was really the only benefit of buying online, though."
5,2022-08-11,"Scent is amazing, great price"
5,2015-03-03,"I bought this candle flavor just before Christmas to add some holiday spirit to the air.  Generally I am not a candle person, but this one was overwhelmingly wonderful.  It will even linger softly in the background into the next day.  This is my third purchase of this particular scent.It is a scent I strongly recommend.  Unlit it smells strong, but it burns softly....just sending out a pleasant hint of wonderful."
5,2018-01-30,"This is now one of my favorite candles.  Strong smell.  Great for a large area.  May be too much for smaller areas.  I smell more vanilla and just a touch of cinnamon.  I try to get smells to reflect the season, and this will be my new post Christmas/pre-spring candle."
5,2022-05-01,Each candle lasts over 120 hours. Great scent.
5,2020-09-10,"My favorite candle ever !!  I use coupons and get them at the yankee store for a few dollars cheaper , but perfect if you don’t have a coupon. Cheaper than Walmart . I love yankee!!!"
5,2021-12-30,The candle was packaged really well to ensure it didn’t break during shipping. Yankee Candle has always put out good scents and this did not disappoint!
5,2022-06-28,Makes home smell so great
5,2022-06-03,Vanilla scent is awesome.
5,2019-11-23,I love this scent! It’s just so Fall-ish! Not sure why some people are saying no scent. ?? Lots of scent. Arrived in perfect condition as well. A little more than I wanted to pay but I wanted this scent and didn’t want to go looking for it.
5,2022-03-15,"Smells great, last long, expensive but a good product."
5,2022-01-14,"Home Sweet Home is and has been the scent I love the most. People come in my house and tell me how good my house smells! Even guys, lol"
5,2020-02-29,"Quick delivery and love the smell! It smells very sweet if you just smell the candle itself before burning, but I think it gives off a very warm and delicious smell that’s not overly sweet once it gets going. Delicious!"
5,2022-07-20,Of course it smells good
5,2021-03-19,"This is a nice smelling candle that made my home smell yummy. Burned evenly. I will buy again. Also, came wonderfully packaged."

5,2022-01-11,My favorite scent of Yankee candle.  Fast shipping and great prices
5,2022-01-14,"Chocolate scented candles are really hard to find in stores. This candle was not cheap, but Yankee never lets you down with the quality of their candles. This was a gift for my husband and he loved it."
5,2019-12-11,"I don't live in the US and I don't think I've ever had something ""pumpkin spice"" but I was curious so decided to give this candle a shot.  I just received it yesterday, but it smells really good.  Maybe there is something to the craze?"
5,2021-07-22,It smells so good you will almost want to eat it. My house smells like chocolate cake or brownies.
5,2020-06-23,I am in love with this Salted Caramel Scented Yankee Candle. It has a cool whiff of caramel with a hint of sea salt. Warm whiff when lit it gives of the long lasting smell of warm caramel candy. It's very inviting. My whole entire house smells very tasty!
5,2021-09-13,"If you love the smell of brownies baking in your home, this is amazing. Everytime I burn this candle, I start craving a bite of anything chocolate."
5,2022-04-18,Perfect balance of aroma. The best.ab
5,2022-02-12,As expected and described! Love the candle from this brand and it lasts a long time.
5,2020-08-09,"Favorite brand of candle, favorite flavor. I have a very sensitive sense of smell and this vanilla is soft and not too heavy for me to experience, which is hard to find in scented things."
5,2021-12-28,I love this Yankees and have gotten it for years for Christmas 🎄
5,2022-03-13,This is one of the best Senst Yankee Candle  has it has perfect throw and it smells the whole house up like your baking. last forever

5,2021-07-02,Always one of my favorite scents. Never disappoints! Vanilla cupcake is just a perfect vanilla scent for me.
5,2022-05-09,Great product highly recommend
5,2021-04-15,"Smells great. Def worth it for $16.88. I see the price can fluctuate to nearly $30 though, and thats way to much for a candle."
5,2018-10-06,"It arrived today, Oct. 6, 2018.  Its' jar was broken.  Fortunately, only at the top.  As though it'd been a pie that was cut into thirds, with its' lid for ever gone, it's lit, smell's nice.  The condition, for your information, of the candle, I'll credit the transport, if not the arrival of this package."
5,2021-03-12,got it as a gift for my wife and she loves it.
5,2022-06-23,I loved the price!
5,2022-05-27,Good price compared to the store
5,2020-12-25,I liked this and good smell and good price altbough I found out if you get this right wax melts you can get more smell longer for the money
5,2022-05-11,I love the smell! Light and yet fragrant!
5,2022-02-24,"What can I say. It's a candle.  Smells amazing,  seems to last a pretty long time,  nice jar with a nice tight lid.  After using it a few times I just clicked right back and ordered a second one."
5,2021-12-31,If you like really sweet dents this is a great candle
5,2021-12-04,It is a Yankee Candle! It sells itself! Great smell and always makes a great gift or for yourself!
5,2021-12-07,I love the scent of this candle. Getting it in the large size means I have it around for a while.
5,2022-01-10,I love candles especially Yankee they burn for a long time! I use them in the basement where I smoke in the winter!!
5,2020-08-29,"This was a great birthday gift. Vanilla Cupcake smells great and perfect for the occasion and a large double wick for $16 in this brand?! Um, please and thank you!"
5,2019-12-12,I don’t personally know what’s in these things. But my mother loves them. I get them two at a time for her three times a year. She is nuts about them. So I can only imagine they are amazing or she is hoarding a ton of candles.
5,2021-08-13,This product smells so wonderful!  It helps with getting rid of the odor after you've cooked!
5,2021-02-28,"Yankee Candles are still the best! I usually only buy them on sale, and for the price, I COULD NOT pass this one up. Most of their “apple” scents are appealing, so this one did not disappoint. The longevity outlasts most other brands."
5,2018-09-23,"I picked this scent up during one of Amazon's deals. I must say, it's one of the nicest scents I've bought. It makes my home smell so welcoming and warm. And with the weather getting cooler, the scent makes me feel comfortable and happy. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a scent that makes you happy to be home."
5,2019-10-29,"The Salted Caramel one h has been my favorite ever since it was introduced. It is such a sweet, comforting aroma suitable for all seasons. It always burns well. I love giving these as gifts because they are always well-loved!"
5,2020-01-17,Scent is awesome! Not too over powering. But enough to smell. The candle it’s self lasts a very long time in my opinion. Any Yankee Candle does. I also gave as a gift around Christmas and no woman is ever upset with a candle!
5,2017-09-20,"I bought this for our office at work and wow, it definitely smells very strongly of fresh chocolate cake or, as I often mistook the smell for, fresh brownies!The two other people in my office complained that they hated this candle because it smelled TOO good, kept making them hungry! LMAO! Good stuff!"
5,2020-12-27,Got the salted carmel for my work gift exchange. Smells amazing and was a hit with my coworker. Not sure how it burns as it was a gift.
5,2021-02-04,Gave this to my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! It’s probably the first one that has a long lasting wide reaching smell.
5,2022-06-01,Mucha fragancia
5,2021-04-13,I love the smell of vanilla my favorite  next one is coconut. daughter and I.love it.I just got some for us again

5,2021-10-03,Wonderful scent from this long-lasting Yankee Candle. You won't be disappointed.
5,2019-05-15,I LOVE Yankee candles! I hate going into the Yankee store though because all the varying scents give me a headache. I was grateful to find them here. These candles can outburn any other store candle I've ever bought! The scent fills the home and is refreshing!
5,2021-01-19,"Got it as a gift for someone but I should have kept it for myself because it smelled awesome. 5/5 would recommend, would buy again."
5,2020-12-25,Very nice scent. Not too strong.  Makes the house smell nice even if it isn't lit for a few days if it is left without the lid on.
5,2021-03-13,"I love Yankee Candles-they are uniformly dependable.  Vanilla is my go-to scent, and this candle met all expectations."
5,2020-04-10,This scent is my favorite!! I like a strong scent and this definitely has one will definitely fill up a big room with this amazing scent and even after the candles blown out you can still smell the scent for hours
5,2021-01-08,"HAVE ALWAYS LIKED MOST YANKEE CANDLES, THIS A FAVORITE. SADLY YANKEE CANDLE HAS KEPT MARKING THEIR CANDLES UP AND UP....WAY OVERPRICED."
5,2021-10-10,This is one of my favorite scents from Yankee Candle. It's fall in a jar.
5,2020-06-30,I’ve had this candle for quite a while and i use it every few days for at least a few hours. i’m still only half way through it. i love yankee candle and this is one of my favorite scents. smells amazing and sweet but it’s not overly strong. still smells up my room fast.
5,2019-12-13,I feel like I done sunk into a vanilla cupcake and can’t eat my way out! If you want to drown in the lovely vanilla scent look no further as this candle has all your smelly needs! Poot in its direction and you won’t have to worry because all you get is a beautiful vanilla smell!
5,2018-12-12,"I don't know who did what in packaging these candles ,but they where packaged awesome . Thanks amazon or Yankee candle for your care in packaging . Everybody knows Yankee candles are one of the best candles to have so getting it with out damaging it is awesome  in my book ."

5,2022-04-04,Terrific sweet woodsy scent!
5,2021-03-03,You can smell this candle hours after it’s been put out and that’s a good thing. It really does smell like chocolate cake. It’s amazing.
5,2021-10-02,"Smell is amazing, looks beautiful and price is great. This was a great buy. I recommend."
5,2022-08-14,Wish it smelled longer but it is pretty good.
5,2019-08-25,"Purchased as a gift for my DIL, but I was desperate for some self-indulgent ambiance!  This is and always been a favorite.  As for scent, Yankee doesn’t disappoint!  I use a candle topper to ensure even burning and for longevity."
5,2020-10-24,"Just what I wanted.  I love these candles.  Love the scent, great for my kitchen.  Lasts a long time, not a cheap candle.  I would give this as a gift."
5,2021-02-06,"The perfect, Autumn, scent of this candle is not too strong...it is definitely a favorite! It also makes a great gift that others can enjoy!"
5,2022-06-17,I love the scent!
5,2018-10-16,The candles here on Amazon were half the price of buying them at Yankee. This home sweet home is my favorite scent. HSs the spicy fall feeling. It is my go to scent
5,2021-05-28,"I love this scent so much, it’s a forever favorite of mine. Yankee candles never fail to satisfy me lol"
5,2021-01-25,"This is a very nice scent. It is a little heavy though, so I only light it for a short time to fill the room with it's fragrance."
5,2022-03-03,Nice scent lasts a long time
5,2021-07-30,Makes me want to eat cupcakes. Scent is great. Burn a long time.  Love Yankee candles.
5,2021-10-26,"This is one of my favorite fall candles, very apple heavy with a nice undertone of pumpkin."
5,2018-05-16,Nice - winter months and a closed up house begs for the scent of either spices or fir trees - this is not overwhelming and not sweet - just right and they candles in this size last and last and last.
5,2022-01-13,"My DIL's favorite candle,  she loved it!"
5,2020-02-05,"But for Valentine's gift, but these candles burn. Beautifully they don't burn a hole down the center, but they can become liquefied at top and burn evenly all the way down simply love this product."
5,2022-04-03,Reminds me of xmas eve with my grandmother.
5,2020-09-02,Fell in love with the smell when I found it in the store but thought the 30.00 price tag was outrageous!  Found it on Amazon almost half the price!
5,2022-06-24,expensive gift
5,2021-02-05,"As usual Yankee Candle makes great candles, and great scents. This Vanilla Cupcake is another excellent scented candle."
5,2020-02-16,"So many candles smell nice when you're deciding to buy them, then you get them home, light them up and wonder what happened to the scent. Wife loves the aroma (it lasts till it's gone)."
5,2021-11-22,Smelled great but was a little expensive for how long it lasted.
5,2020-04-15,This is the most wonderful candle.  Great for real estate agents to use for sure.Smells like chocolate cake or cookies are baking.  I've purchased this several times.
5,2021-12-11,I've found they burn most evenly with a topper.
5,2021-07-17,Wonderful smell. I sent one of these for a gift and it arrived very safely packaged.
5,2019-10-31,I love the scent of this spiced pumpkin.  I don't light most of the Yankee candles I buy.  I remove the lids and just place them around the house.  The scent is very strong on this candle.  I'm very happy with it.
5,2021-04-02,Great candle!
5,2020-11-08,"The scent is nice, however it was not strong. The candle burns beautifully for a long time, it’s such a pit that the scent was not strong."
5,2022-01-04,Liked the smell and could be a nice little gift
5,2020-02-12,Love Yankee candles and this large was at a great price! House smells great..home sweet home..my favorite scent!
5,2020-06-11,"Love the smell of this candle, it reminds me of being at my parents home."

5,2020-02-18,I can't live without a couple Yankee Candles in my house burning at all times as for great Ambience and always has an amazing smell yes cost a little more than the generic ones but definitely worth the money
5,2020-09-14,I'm so picky with candle scents and this one... is absolutely amazing. This would make a great addition to your space or to buy as a gift!
5,2020-01-06,My Favorite....candles..No fiery smell..The wicks..long enough...Not 2 get in the wayOf the melted waxTht sometimes..With other candles..Makes the flame go out

5,2021-03-21,This candle lasted a long time!It' so pretty too. So I bought more at this good price ! Thanks
5,2020-11-16,I don't typically like sweetly scented candles but this is so good.  It's a rich and deep cocoa scent.  Smells like baking brownies.
5,2021-06-21,Yankee candles scents last throughout the life of the candle! Good value as well.
5,2019-04-04,"This smells like pancakes/waffles. And I do mean exactly. Within ten min of lighting this, someone will ask if I’m cooking something breakfast/maple syrup related. I love this candle but it will make you crave all things maple syrup related."
5,2022-03-12,Happy with product
5,2021-01-14,Good smell and glad it wasn’t broken normally when I order candles they come broken this one was in perfect shape!
5,2022-01-21,Made a great holiday gift and smells soooooo amazing!
5,2020-11-18,"Great candle, awesome scent that lasts & fills up your home, long burn time. I order the yankee candles very often & always satisfied."
5,2019-12-25,Great strong scent for first half of jar.  Scent not quite so strong after that.  Good value compared to same product in stores. I have re- purchased same (Home Sweet Home) candle for a second time.
5,2021-12-12,Love the cookie smell type yankee candles! Makes the home smell great!!!
5,2021-03-11,I love the smell of vanilla. I just wish it would last longer. I use it all day and it lasts about 3 days.
5,2021-11-25,You can't beat Yankee candles for great scents
5,2021-11-25,"Always purchase Yankee Candles, they last the longest and have a very nice scent."
5,2020-09-13,"Definitely fills the air with sweetness so if you don’t like sweet smelling candles then skip this, but if you do this one is heavenly"
5,2020-10-13,My candle came today. Super low price. Even cheaper than bath and body works and double the size. it's only been lit for an hour and already my room smells amazing. <3
5,2022-01-10,It’s a yankee candle it’s going to smell good. But for the price i was expecting more of a wow factor bc the candles at Walmart are cheaper and do just about the same thing
5,2021-11-12,I like the scent of this candle. Unable to find it locally.
5,2022-03-13,Highly recommend
5,2021-07-29,I like the scent.  I bought it as a gift for a relative that wanted it.
5,2021-09-03,"Great candle, smells Yummy, got it on sale at a great price👍🏼"
5,2021-03-17,Great deal better then the outlet
5,2021-01-05,Yankee Candles always smell good until the end...although I would prefer a less black soot burn of soy wax.
5,2021-03-06,I have gifted this scent many times - everyone loves Yankee candles and this is my favorite scent.
5,2021-07-24,Wonderful scent. Good room coverage. Very gift able. Will buy again.
5,2022-04-19,Fragrance
5,2020-07-25,"Yum, great sale price, glad ordered 2. Packed well, shipped fast. Think I may zen out."
5,2018-10-23,"This candle is phenomenal, I have been searching for this scent for a long time after smelling it once, it does'nt smell much like apples or pumpkins, but more like happiness and a cool fall day with a hint of Christmas is around the corner. I will buy this thing on repeat."
5,2021-12-27,"It smells great and strong, but not overpowering. Honestly if you can't smell your yankee candle, you should go get a Covid test."
5,2020-10-01,"More expensive than your typical candle, but it’s reflected in the quality. The candle is powerful where the scent truly carries throughout our 2 story house- our high schooler came downstairs when I lit the salted caramel scent because he thought I was baking something...haha"
5,2020-01-10,I quit buying Yankee Candles several years ago due to them getting smokie. I decided to take the leap when I saw these were on sale for less than $15.00.  Excellent decision !  I forgot just how much I love their Pumpkin Spice Candles. I bought 4 .  Now if I could only find the French Vanilla .
5,2021-01-04,"My favorite scent from Yankee, the only candle I buy from them anymore unless they're having an excellent sale."
5,2014-02-11,"Although I bought these candles for a friend who absolutely LOVES the scent, I still have several of my own, and there are few things that can cheer me up during this miserable winter we are having in western New York like that aroma.  I honestly find it MUCH harder to be depressed about the snow and extreme cold when I have one of those candles burning.  Why?  It's a HAPPY scent and it works every time!!!!!!!!"
5,2020-10-01,Looking for something to make your house smell like you just baked a fresh chocolate cake from scratch. Look no further this is it. Super yummy!
5,2020-12-15,Wonderful scent. Lasts very long and burns nicely. Came in a very sturdy box ready to be gifted but I loved it and kept for myself!
5,2021-01-08,Like spicy air and Yankee always fills the bill. The clearance center offers good buys on large candles.
5,2020-10-19,"This is one of the best-smelling vanilla candles I've used.  It's a little pricey, but it has a pleasant scent that is worth the cost."
5,2021-09-11,Smell the difference !Nothing compares to Yankee Candles
5,2022-01-23,Seems to last. Smells good.
5,2019-02-16,This candle has a strong smell of cinnamon that permeates the entire mid size room.  It burns evenly with my Yankee candle toppers. I liked the first candle so much I ordered a second one for our Master BR.  Recommend this particular Yankee candle!
5,2022-03-07,Love the fragrance
5,2021-06-30,This candle lets off a delicious scent. Its vanilla without being over powering. Love it and will buy again. It will be a good one to light before people come over then it smells like you just baked something.
5,2021-12-12,I’ve never had the “Kitchen Spice” and I really like it! For a Yankee Candle it was a great price and I would definitely buy again.
5,2021-04-27,great
5,2022-01-29,"Love this scent!  Always a favorite to that I look for.Burned up much faster then Yankee Candles used to, also burned much less uneven leaving wax rings. Very unlike past purchases."
5,2020-12-12,Smells so good. You cannot go wrong with Yankee Candles. Each one is like a piece of heaven in your home. The smell lasts a long time and always keep the seasonal scents stocked up.
5,2021-10-07,This smelt so good I almost wanted to eat it.
5,2021-03-11,This scent is scrumptious! Just like a pumpkin pie baking in the oven! The throw is great! It was packaged very very well. I’m very happy with my purchase!
5,2020-12-14,This is one of the only scents I really love from Yankee. It’s a yummy strong scent. Always smells so good.
5,2021-12-02,Candle lasts great with very good scent. Worth it!
5,2019-02-16,"It will make you want cake. Not a piece, not a slice, a whole cake. Best of luck to you and your respective diets."

5,2022-02-05,Best candles ever
5,2020-04-21,Purchased as a birthday gift without knowing how it smells. The recipient loved the scent
5,2015-09-23,"Holy moly. I kinda splurged on this pricey boy because of the reviews. It does not disappoint. It smells like fall pie in the oven. Can't get over how strong the aroma is. Be sure to put it in a big room as its pretttttay potent lol. It's a sweet smell but not too sweet, like an apple pumpkin pie baking in the oven. Great buy, will purchase more in the future. Happy Fall Y'all! :)"
5,2021-05-05,I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she loved it. Yankee candles are the best.

5,2022-01-06,Smells good and last long time.
5,2021-01-08,Smells amazing.  The lid was cracked.  Not jagged.  Just a crack.  Works great.  Would buy again from you.
5,2021-03-25,It's a very good product to Yankee candle always is it smells very great last a long time.
5,2018-01-23,My favorite Yankee Candle scent. I prefer a one wick candle. These are so easy to light - compared to an expensive three wick candle I purchased from a competitor. Just remember to trim the wick occasionally.
5,2021-04-12,"This is one of the most fragrant , great smelling, yankee candle..buy it for everyone!"
5,2022-03-27,Highly recommended!

5,2020-11-20,Love the fragrance and the candle is extremely long lasting! Very affordable price! Thank you Amazon!👍🏻😊
5,2020-06-16,Love these candles because they last forever! They may be more expensive but you also don’t have to replace as often! Smells great and came sooner than expected!
5,2022-07-30,"Best candle for the kitchen, great for those after cooking smells..fish etc. Sents the whole house."
5,2022-03-27,Lasted 12 days! Great vanilla aroma!
5,2022-06-30,I love how this makes our house smell! I have bought several in the past and will continue to purchase these in the future as long as Amazon carries them.
5,2020-10-26,Smells great just like chocolate.  The jar was a bit waxy but looked like it had melted but smells great.  Took longer to get here but all is good.
5,2022-02-03,Fantastic smell
5,2020-12-08,"I burn this when I want guests to think I have been baking. I love the scent, but sometimes it makes me hungry"
5,2020-06-26,Absolutely My Favorite Scent! My husband loooves this! I burn it in my room and it smells delish! It smells freshly baked sweet cupcakes!!!!!
5,2022-04-16,"Too exepensive, smells amazing"
5,2022-01-05,"Smells great, long lasting."
5,2021-05-05,"Got this for a present for my roommate - she loves the scent, and so do I."
5,2020-10-17,I was nervous to buy this because the mountain lodge and crisp night have zero scent but this is very strong.
5,2022-03-10,Great candle
5,2019-09-09,"My favorite scent! Be sure to let the entire surface layer turn to liquid before you blow it out, so it burns evenly."
5,2020-06-18,I'm a pumpkin spice gal and Yankee candles are great quality candles. I love that I can get my autumn pumpkin fix anytime of the year!
5,2019-12-31,"As someone who loves fall and pumpkins all year and not just for one season, this is something I’ll repurchase again and again. I love the fact that it was packaged so securely and didn’t arrive broken like some other reviews showed. The scent carries through the house, and reminds me of my favorite time of year."
5,2017-05-03,"Not sure what the deal is with the reviewer stating this is an imposter. It most certainly is not. I've gotten two so far, and they are 100% genuine Yankee Candles. I personally love the smell, but I had previously purchased in store so I knew I'd like it. 👌🏼👌🏼"
5,2020-12-10,"Better longevity than cheaper candles, so actually a good deal. I burn them every day to cheer up the house during the winter."
5,2020-10-10,"Smells great. My first order arrived melted and unusable, but amazon shipped a replacement immediately. Will buy again"
5,2021-01-02,Given as a gift. It is her favorite and apparently hard to find. It was very well received.
5,2015-05-21,"1st off Yankee Candles are #1 in my book. One of the few candle lines that burns even from top to bottom. The scent is also present from beginning to end. Often times, on less expensive candles, you will only smell the fragrance for the first few days. I am told that with these less expensive candles, the oils are only added to the top half of the candle. This particular candle is wonderful and true to the description. It makes my home smell wonderful. I will warn you, however, it will make you hungry!! :0)"
5,2022-01-05,Great for gifting with this sent or different scents.
5,2022-02-10,"This candle gives off a lovely vanilla scent.  Not too strong or sweet, it is a warm, light, delicious scent suitable for any room in the house."
5,2021-01-22,"Great scent, is burning evenly, and smells great every day. No loss of scent as it burns down."
5,2021-06-10,My house smells like chocolate all my neighbors thought I was baking a cake
5,2020-09-04,Second time purchasing this scent. One of my favorites that actually omits scent to a few rooms. Same price as Wally World.
5,2021-01-27,recently Yankee Candles don't have that strong scent i was used to. Not sure what's going on
5,2019-08-01,"Lovely smelling, true to description candle. Long-lasting and great scent. Wick burns nicely without a lot of the ""junk"" build-up. Typical excellent Yankee Candle quality. Almost good enough to eat! A+"
5,2021-09-27,Love these candles  ~ difficult to find in stores
5,2021-02-18,"Nice large size candle with a great scent. Not too light or too strong, but just right."
5,2020-11-16,Great packaging didn't come in broken or damaged. and they candle smells amazing! awesome job Yankee!
5,2022-01-09,"I have been buying these candles for years because I love the scent, however my last order was very disappointing because it gave no scent whatsoever.  I would really like an explanation As to what is going on.  I will not reorder.  Disappointing customer ☹️"
5,2020-10-21,Love the scent as well as the longevity of this candle. Fills my entire home with a wonderful fragrance.
5,2022-02-15,No problem.
5,2020-05-21,this was discontinued or retired by yankee and i couldn't find it in the stores. ..i love this scent!! glad i could get 2 big jars here!
5,2020-12-31,"Great scent, burns well, and lasts long! Great sale and appreciate the care they took to ship it."
5,2021-10-29,The scent really is CHOCOLATE!
5,2021-12-09,Makes a great gift . Smells good
5,2021-12-03,Glad we can still get this scent.
5,2022-02-18,Smells nice. I use it in my Sun room.
5,2021-10-14,Love this candle for my new house!
5,2018-07-17,"I think this product is being discontinued by the company. I only found one size on their site, and it was over $30. This was $20 and the smell is still potent, and the wax is supple. This candle will last you thru the fall if burned every day for hours."
5,2013-06-06,"I love candles of all kinds, but when I first saw these at bed bath and beyond that is where I began buying them. I fell in love with all of the different scents. When I found them on Amazon, I was DELIGHTED because I did not have to drive into town to buy them, I could just have them delivered to me when ever I wanted from amazon.  It helped since I live an 45-60 minutes away from the nearest city. Thanks Amazon and Yankee Candle Company, I am a happy camper."
5,2022-01-07,The scents are Amazing and they don’t fade as the candle gets smaller. I have tried many others and there is no candle that I like more than a Yankee Candle!  This one is my favorite scent for Thanksgiving time.
5,2021-08-14,My favorite candle! Amazon is the best shopping place in the world. I love the fast delivery and every product is perfect. Thank you so much for all your employees do.
5,2019-10-31,"the fragrance is lovely, its cost reasonable, plus it lasts a nice long time.  I don't  gift candles by choice.  I'm happy that Amazon carries Yankee candles in many sizes & scents."
5,2019-01-22,"Love it!!!!  Don’t freak out, it takes a few mins (longer than other Yankee candles) for the scent to permeate.  It is one of the very best Yankee Candle scents because it is VERY natural.  It isn’t an artificial or syrupy scent."
5,2021-08-01,Smells heavenly!
5,2022-05-07,This was purchased for a Christmas gift for my kids father. It is the only kind of candle that he burns and could not find them anywhere anymore and he loves the smell of the vanilla in them. ￼
5,2021-11-03,Great fresh smell. A favorite.
5,2020-12-13,The scent is delicious !!! It is a huge candle ! All house smells like caramel! Lovely!

5,2022-02-25,This is my absolute favorite scent put out by Yankee. Everyone who walks into my house says it smells like I'm baking. The candles last a long time especially if you use a topper to control the flame.
5,2019-07-08,I love Yankee Candle. I bought this one recently and was very satisfied with it. The scent is lovely and it came as expected. It is a large jar and has hours of use. I would recommend this candle!

5,2019-12-29,"I bought this for my roommates for Christmas, because she said she liked Yankee candles. It’s burning all the time when she’s home, she likes it so much."
5,2020-08-07,"It's not always easy to get a candle scent right. Yankee did it with this one.  Yum.  And PS - thanks for shipping it correctly, it really makes all the difference."

5,2021-07-23,The scent warms your whole house like you just took something out of the oven. The longevity of the smell lingers. I would give this gift away to a friend as a birthday present.
5,2020-09-24,I’ve had CHRONIC MIGRAINES for decades. Most scents are a trigger. Cinnamon isn’t & I really like these!!
5,2017-12-05,"These are the best smelling candles I have ever used. When they were new to the market, I could get them for $5 each, but over the years the price just went way up as they started to realize their true value. I bought 10 of these and they should last a year or more. You get what you pay for - they provide a wonderful cinnamon scent - more powerful than those 'mart' brands if you know what I mean"
5,2021-12-16,I absolutely love these  candles. They throw off an amazing scent which lasts a long time. I absolutely love it
5,2020-02-19,"The scent is AMAZING!!!!! My first one did arrive broken, but the replacement was completely perfect. I burned it for a few hours last night and it was awesome."

5,2022-03-06,Loved the price and scent
5,2020-11-17,This is the second purchase of this candle. It smells so good that I burn it all season!

5,2022-04-11,LOVE it one of my favorites!
5,2020-02-22,"I am sorry to say this candle was a great disappointment. It had no throw, meaning you could not smell it burning even after an hour. This isn’t the first time this has happened."

5,2022-03-06,Love the scent!

5,2021-08-23,Yankee candles are always great!
5,2011-10-20,"Totally as expected with the Yankee Candle brand. Has a wonderful Fall spicy smell. Although I bought it, I may not get to keep it. It is a prize for the top raffle ticket sales in our association. But I am selling tickets like crazy because I really want to own one of these for myself. Candles have a real calming effect on me and Yankee candles always do have a great smell."
5,2018-01-24,"I bought this candle before Christmas after purchasing the melts on clearance from a local retailer and this scene is INCREDIBLE!  Anyone who walks in the front door comments immediately ""What in the world smells so good"". I will absolutely stockpile obnoxious amounts of this scent to make sure I don't run out all year long!  Hands down my all time FAVORITE SCENT! """
5,2021-12-05,Love the smell
5,2020-04-10,Absolutely totally completely loved this candle and will be re-purchasing it lasted so much longer than I expected and smelled so delicious got so many compliments when somebody stepped in my home
5,2021-03-01,"You will LOVE the smell of this candle!  Lasts a long time, very fragrant"
5,2021-03-07,Delightful scent.Long lasting.Appreciated gift.
5,2021-09-06,"I love the smell of this candle! Reminds me of all the scents of fall, rolled into one candle! And, I think it smells better when lit, then just the scent out of the unlit jar!"
5,2019-12-28,Gave it as a thank you gift to a pumpkin spice lover and she was very pleased. Not an overwhelming fake scent . Just nice and clean.
5,2021-02-26,Love the smell and the burning is longevity.
5,2021-01-04,"Cinnamon smell was lovely, not overwhelming to bother allergies."
5,2021-05-17,Great price for a great candle!
5,2020-07-22,Smells great
1,2016-09-18,"I purchase Yankee Candles regularly, an array of different scents throughout the year. Every 8th or 9th purchase yields a candle that is so devoid of fragrance as to make dubious the claim that it is a scented candle at all. This purchase of Sparkling Cinnamon is another example. After burning it for at least two hours, it smelled like ... absolutely nothing. Even inhaling deeply near the lip of the burning candle yielded no discernible scent. Yankee Candle needs to do a better job ensuring consistency of formula and product design. It is frustrating to pay $27 for a ""scented"" candle that is, in fact, unscented."
5,2021-07-08,Really good candle
5,2020-08-23,I received my candle and the delivery man did a great job. Biggest complaint is my candle got melted in the AZ heat to one side of the jar so I had to set it outside to melt again.
5,2021-01-07,Typically great Yankee Candle! Delicious Vanilla scent!
5,2020-01-21,This is my favorite flavor! It smells so awesome and it last for a verryy long time! Fills my whole house with such a wonderful smell!
5,2022-04-05,Great candle smells good
5,2021-01-06,Low this. it smells great and the price was excellent
5,2022-01-06,I got this as a birthday gift for my friend. When I was wrapping it I kept getting big whiffs of the most delightful scent. If this wasn't a gift I would've immediately unboxed it and lit it.
5,2021-06-27,So giftable smells great
5,2021-03-09,What can you say bad about yankee candles nothing! As always loved the aroma thats the reason I buy them. Highly recommend yankee candles
5,2021-10-27,Yankee stopped carrying this in thier store so we are happy to have gotten it here
5,2021-06-25,Quick delivery. Smell wonderful
5,2019-12-31,I love these candles and usually buy some for Christmas gifts.  They make wonderful presents.  Great scents for the whole house.
5,2021-08-29,Love this
5,2021-03-23,"Smells good, smells like yellow cake batter."
5,2019-05-22,Bought this as a gift for friend when I went to visit her and she loves it!!  She uses it every time she cooks and the smell is so pleasant and works great at removing unwanted odors
5,2021-08-03,Loved the smell
5,2020-04-29,This is my absolute favorite candle! It smells a bit like strawberry ice cream. I havent found anything like it.
5,2022-04-04,I will get this again
5,2020-01-14,You can’t go wrong buying a Yankee candle.  When you find them on sale just pull the trigger.  The scent and longevity are worth it.
5,2018-10-04,"I love the scent. I wanted something that had that Fall feel/scent and this was exactly what I was looking for. Spices, cinnamon, apple, pumpkin. It’s a large candle too for the price and not a weak smell."
5,2020-07-06,Burns clean and scent travels around the apartment yet not overpowering. Would buy again.
5,2020-02-09,"Best candle on the market burns for days and days. Just check Walmart before you buy, they had some on sale for $7 the other day, exactly the same as this."
5,2021-08-03,Great product
5,2021-02-03,It smells very red. It has adequate longevity. I gave 7 away and all but 1 were given back to me so I wouldn't rate them high on giftability.
5,2019-07-18,"This has always been our favorite among all the Yankee Candles! Buttercream has an amazing aroma, makes our home smell incredible and the price was fabulous. Definitely a must have and we highly recommend Buttercream scent!"
5,2021-11-22,"I was given a smaller Yankee candle in this fragrance and wanted another one.  I don't usually like sweet smelling candles, but there's something about this one that I really like."
5,2021-07-30,Great product

5,2019-02-05,Saw negative reviews but got a great deal. So. Ordered anyways! No issues here everything was packaged fine nothing was broken as the scent is the same as any other one I've purchased
5,2021-01-23,I love this scent great buy.~wife’s review
5,2019-03-16,Oh the scent is the perfect mixture of apple and pumpkin. One of my fall favorites! I collect all the Yankee candle scents and as a candle hoarder this Amazon price beat Yankee!
5,2020-05-13,Smells great.
5,2019-12-09,"Highly Recommend, especially around the holidays, great scent."
5,2020-01-02,I liked mine so much that I purchased another one has a gift. Beautiful scent created a wonderful Ambience for the holidays.
5,2019-12-23,"I love this scent, but it's hard to find and much more expensive in stores. This makes a great gift for someone ""who has everything."""
5,2018-05-02,"Loved this product, burning the candle almost everyday and it still lasted me nearly three months. A little expensive, but it was very much worth the buy, and the scent was very strong. High quality candle that I would definitely buy again."
5,2018-10-20,"I love this candle. Classic pumpkin scent, it is an essential part of October in my home. Love love love it and the price on amazon was actually cheaper than Meijer. Free 2 day shipping... I’m a happy gal."
5,2020-12-06,"Great gift. Smells great, lasts forever, and worth every penny."
5,2020-12-05,Love yankee candles. Scent is nice not overbearing. Lasts long.
5,2021-04-15,Reasonably priced. Smells terrific.
5,2020-10-21,"Love this scent, perfect for fall months. Quick delivery and great price"
5,2020-12-29,Amazing warm and cozy scent. Have this candle on auto replenish.
5,2021-05-29,Best Yankee Candle scent.
5,2020-08-18,Easy gift for my daughter. She is in love with this scent. I love walking into her house and smelling it too
5,2021-05-23,"Great scent, excellent quality."
5,2021-01-30,You can never go wrong with a vanilla Yankee Candle!
5,2019-12-06,Half the price. Bought 4 for gifts. Excellent packaging when shipped. All arrived in mint condition. Will definitely buy again.
5,2019-05-18,This candle makes it always smell like I’m cooking brownies... mmm ... the only negative is it makes me brownies haha! It truly smells delicious esp for chocolate lovers!
5,2020-10-16,Very nice scent that fills a large room and lingers after it is put out.
5,2013-05-16,"When this candle is lit in our house, it's funny how often people who come through the front door ask if there's a cake in the oven.  I know the candle is there but that's sometimes still the first thought I have when I notice the lovely vanilla cake scent.  It smells just like yellow cake baking.  The smell is not overpowering- if you are in the same room as the candle for a while you may not even notice it anymore, but it is definitely potent enough to fill our whole downstairs living space with the scent of a baking cake.  I love the smell, although it does make me crave sweets, and you must be ready to disappoint guests that you have no cake for them."
5,2019-10-06,Don’t buy this unless you have a lot of self control. It’s wonderful chocolate fragrance is exactly like a cake and makes you want to eat!
5,2021-12-28,These candles used to smell awesome but I think they took the scent out of them. Its It's too bad especially how much they cost they're just not worth the money. I'll be looking for a new brand that has a lasting room filling scent. 😤
5,2021-01-28,Yankee candles are a bit pricey but worth it.
5,2020-11-19,"Candle does not last long, smell is faint, burns unevenly in jar."
5,2021-06-25,medium slow burn time
5,2022-01-10,"Light in scent but, it's ok"
5,2019-01-15,I ordered these as Christmas gifts. I was concerned about them breaking but they were packaged very nicely. The apple pumpkin smells great and this size lasts a long time. Great buy.
5,2020-06-10,love this product !!!  It is the maximum
5,2022-03-12,Yankees candles have no equal
5,2021-04-10,Wife loves it. All that matters.
5,2019-02-14,Doesn't everybody know by now that Yankee candles are the best?  They smell great and they last forever.  Very nice gift for any occasion including doing something nice for yourself.
5,2020-01-05,Caramel scented candles are hard to find in my local stores. I love this one and of course Yankee Candle is always high quality.

5,2020-01-09,Favorite year around scent. Home Sweet home.
5,2021-02-05,Yankee candle quality and scent. 5 star.
5,2016-11-28,Could smell a little of the vanilla in the beginning but overall you can't even tell you're burning a candle.  My Glade spiced rose & vanilla scented oil candles are far superior to this so don't waste your money.  Yankee Candle isn't what it use to be.  12-11-2016  Am changing my review to (5) stars as after burning it off and on for a number of days the odor really came through so be a little more patient than I was as you will get a pleasant aroma after some time has passed.
5,2020-08-11,I LOVE candles. I especially love pumpkin candles! This candle is my favorite!!
5,2020-11-13,I placed this is my kitchen and it smells wholesome. It smells like fresh baked pumpkin pie right in your oven.
5,2020-12-29,I love the candle the scent is always very good.
5,2018-09-15,Used this Yankee Candle as a birthday gift for a friend born in September......a month of fall! Love the price and course the quality was high. Quick delivery made this a win-win deal.
5,2021-07-16,This is not overpowering. but wonderful. I like Yankee Candles

5,2021-01-09,"This scene certainly warmed up my home this winter season, and the smell wasn't too overpowering/ artificial smelling. Overall well balanced, and the candle lasted a surprising amount of time."
5,2020-01-02,best deal ever on yankee candles.  Came delivered packaged so well I could hardly believe it.  Will definitely buy them again
5,2020-10-22,Love the scent of this candle. Have it in my office.

5,2016-06-13,"The last 4 times we have sold our houses, I have lit a yankee candle 24 hours prior to showing (vanilla) and the house sold to the first buyer, add a good realtor and you have a sweet sale.  (- :"
5,2016-10-18,"Hilariously, I had a few co-workers say this smells like Play-doh!  But it brought them back GOOD memories from when they were a kid.  For the most part I thought it smelled like Strawberries.  Just yummy smelling in general!"
5,2016-01-21,"This was packed and wrapped perfectly. Brand new and great product! I love the smell, Cinnamon and spices to make my house have a nice smell but not too over powering. It is hard to find and wish it was a bit cheaper but it burns for over 40 hours. Would repeat buying it!"
5,2021-01-16,I have ordered this candle from Walmart twice previously and it has arrived twice at my house broken. This candle arrived in one complete piece. The scent is amazing and I would definitely purchase again.
5,2020-03-14,Love this fragrance.  This candle did not seem as strong as usual. Yes I’ll buy it again
5,2013-11-03,"I love this scent--it's kind of just a generic fall-ish smelling scent, with a slight hint of nutmeg and cinnamon. I noticed, though, that I could get the same size and scent candle at TJ Maxx for half the price. I didn't see it until after I ordered this here, or else I wouldn't have ordered it online!"
5,2020-02-08,The package was wrapped/boxed with care and my home smells wonderful

5,2019-01-26,"I bought Vanilla Lime. So far, it’s my favorite from this brand. The house smell so good with this scent. Everyone at home loves it. Though, I agree with other customers about it being on the pricey side."

5,2012-12-12,I purchased this item because my local store only had other brands in stock and I wanted Yankee. I realize I could have drove to a store that stocks them but it was much easier to purchase from Grandma's Giftware with fulfillment through Amazon.The candle was very well packaged in bubble wrap inside double box.All of the wonderful smells of Yankee and the Kitchen Spice reminds me of the holiday season.They are a little more expensive than some of the other brands but I just ordered another one anyway.

5,2015-02-07,"Just what I expect from a Yankee Candle.  They burn forever and I love this scent.  If you trim the wick down,  it burns more even and doesn't blacken the glass.  Yankee makes a trimmer,  duh.  But I love mine."

5,2018-01-29,Best scented candle for the winter especially - the 'salted' part of this tones down the sweetness just right.  I have tried to find it year round but it seems to be available only through the winter - grab them!

I typically go for the Fresh Cut Roses candle, but this is a great and welcome change. The only problem is, now I want some strawberry ice cream!"

5,2013-09-14,"Great scent, permeates a large space well, worth the notorious expense; if receiving from a distant location, be careful when handling the box, candle is heavy and will roll around. Box was left in the heat, integrity of the candle was not compromised, however there was a thin layer of wax on the outside of the candle. This candle is an adequate replacement for several other brands."

Every time I came home into the room it would be a wall of yummy smell that I couldn't get enough of. Every second I spent in the house I was burning the candle and it last for months even though I used it for hours a day. Great quality and great price for the amount of burning time a yummy smell. Recommend to anyone who loves vanilla frosting and a cosy candle.

When I found them on Amazon, I was DELIGHTED because I did not have to drive into town to buy them, I could just have them delivered to me when ever I wanted from amazon.  It helped since I live an 45-60 minutes away from the nearest city. Thanks Amazon and Yankee Candle Company, I am a happy camper."

Would typically be 5 stars, but  this 22 0z candle came with one wic, when normally they have 2 wics for a even burn.  So 3.5 for now, will change to 5 if the candle last more than 30 days of regular use on one wic"

3,2018-09-13,"First of all, I don't think men smell the ""fume"" background smell in this candle, from reading the reviews and hearing what my husband said about it. He thought it smelled GREAT, and he never comments on things like this!  I like the smell of it, but I also am annoyed by another smell in it, which might be the cherry in it. Did you ever use potpourri or wax all of your furniture and then turn on your gas logs, and the fumes of those two things start burning, then you call the fire dept and ask tell them you might have a gas leak in the house, then the fire dept tells you it's just your potpourri burning in the gas logs? That is the smell I'm talking about. There is a slight hint of it in this candle, which I don't like, but I'm not returning it. It still doesn't hold a..candle...to the salted caramel!"
5,2015-10-10,Smells Delish!
5,2019-01-13,Love the bold fragrance; not weak like some other candles. And not mixed with apple spice...just cinnamon.

5,2016-05-24,One of my favorite scents!

5,2014-02-27,The vanilla scent is one of my favorites to help displace cooking odors.  I bought it for a neighbor because she collected my mail and watched my house while I was away on a winter vacation.  Better price from Amazon than in the store.

5,2014-12-23,"New, well packaged"
5,2013-01-03,I looked everywhere for this candle in the fall and no one had this particular one.  I found it on your site where I find anything I want.
5,2015-01-20,"You just can't go wrong.  Quality product that burns right to the bottom ~ wonderful scent that carries. Packaged beautifully, arrived quickly.  Love when items come DIRECT from Amazon!!!"

5,2019-04-19,Good
5,2015-01-07,Smells wonderful.  Used it with the Hurricane Candle Warmer Lantern.
5,2018-01-29,"The scent is amazing! Shipping was quick, it's a little expensive but it's worth it."
5,2013-01-15,A complete house warmer - fills my home with the sweetness of vanilla and makes me crave for cupcake - must buy from Amazon with the best rates they offer !!
5,2017-07-13,Love Yankee Candle!
5,2017-10-11,"Very nice! The scent reminds me mostly of BAYBERRY. Difficult to notice much else from the scent except the Bayberry BUT this candle is becoming a favorite of mine the more I have it going! The scent does remind me much of my personal favorite Yankee Candle Holiday Bayberry.Aside from the comparisons, I do really like this candle! It does contain one of those magical type aroma's I rarely notice, it's a good thing. If you like the smell of BAYBERRY then I strongly recommend trying this candle out.I doubt anyone would not enjoy this one. I need to order another 1 or 2. Loving this candle!"
5,2016-01-12,"Bought this candle for my girlfriend, I've always been a huge Yankee Candle fan. Smelled exactly like one of those awful coffee drinks(coffee should only ever be served black) and she is overjoyed. World class candles, will be buying again."
5,2019-01-13,for the nice fragance it gives to the room
5,2012-10-01,"Smells like warm pumpkin bread or a fresh pumpkin pie baking! A welcoming, comforting scent! Yankee Candle has another winner!"
5,2019-01-12,Perfect mix of spicy and sweet.
5,2018-04-21,Awesome!
5,2017-09-09,Excellent!  Beautiful aroma and lasts longer than most other brands!
5,2021-12-17,"This is one of my favorite candles.  Unfortunately, Yankee Candle has discontinued this scent (shocking right?  I find a scent and in a year, it's gone.).I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I could only get two, and they were pretty pricey, but at least I got more candles in my favorite scent.Buying jarred candles on Amazon is a crap shoot.  They either arrive in perfect condition, or the jar get's broken.  Luckily, these arrived intact."
5,2015-11-05,Wax was a bit melty so had to be cleaned up upon arrival but I love the scent and it's perfect for the fall season!
5,2018-02-02,Excellent service & a wonderful smelling candle!
5,2015-11-19,Such a great smelling candle for fall
5,2019-01-12,"Love the smell, and the long burning time."
5,2015-10-03,Awesome
5,2017-10-12,Love the scent
5,2014-12-16,"Yankee candles never disappoint , my daughter will love this candle and the scent !"
5,2017-10-24,It has a nice fall smell and amazon sells this candle for way cheaper than Yankee Candle
5,2022-06-18,"I remember getting this scent in the Yankees candle store and was upset when it was no longer available. What a surprise when I found it on Amazon! It smells just like chocolate cake, everyone who comes into my house tells me how delicious something smells only to find out it was coming from a candle! The scent lingers for hours even after the candle is extinguished."
5,2013-01-17,Bought this as a last minute Christmas gift and it worked out great!  The smell was very nice and festive.
5,2015-03-19,LOVE!!!
5,2021-06-28,"My favorite candle! The smell is amazing! I’m on my 4th one. Well priced, packaged insanely well. Shipped quick. Highly recommend. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Nice scent, perfect mix of lime and vanilla,  it lingers not cloying but perfect. I keep them in all our bathrooms. Lasts awhile if not burned all day every day. Remember don’t put out until the wax pools completely or you run the risk of it becoming a sink hole and basically ruining the candle. Would make a great gift for any candle lover."
5,2017-11-16,I like the mild frequencie.
5,2014-11-10,"I just loved the smell and made my living room smell great! would definelty buy again, wish they would go for cheaper though or on sale to get more at a time..."
5,2017-06-20,"smells delightful, covers up the smell of my cat's litter box very well."
5,2017-01-06,great fragrance
5,2014-02-12,This is one of my wife's favorite scent for a candle and Yankee and Amazon did not let us down!
5,2013-11-27,great for the holidays! I would recommend to anyone - the scent is not too strong like other candles. just perfect
5,2018-12-25,Smells great
5,2016-10-26,"Yankee Candle is the commercial best in candles, they burn down to the end, and the fragrance is realistic and fills your house with wonderful smells. The only candle worth buying."
1,2020-03-20,Highly suspect this is not a true Yankee Candle.  The smell is always amazing and this one has zero scent even when burning for an hour.  It’s also burned through very quickly. Highly disappointed... do NOT recommend.
5,2016-07-04,Gah. This scent smells like not only fall but it reminds me of going to your grandmas warm house and eating warm cookies in the country. I can't explain the feeling otherwise. Just buy it and you'll see what I mean!
5,2016-03-18,Great smell
5,2018-02-12,Love this candle
5,2014-09-27,Great scent
5,2018-02-19,Exactly what expected!
5,2018-01-11,Fast delivery. Everything was perfect. Love this scent.
5,2022-01-22,Love the smell of chocolate.  Was a bit skeptical buying Yankee because I feel in the last several years their scents aren’t as powerful as they once were.Ordered the chocolate layer cake and it smells awesome.  I have a big home with very high ceilings; thinking the scent would be lost.  But no.  I feel like I’m visiting Hershey PA where the chocolate scent is everywhere.  Need more jars!!!!!
5,2014-10-26,Great autumnal scent
5,2011-02-19,I got exactly what I wanted and it came a lot quicker than I was expecting.  All was well with it when it arrived; I would order again from this vendor.
5,2017-01-14,"The candle was just as expected.....wonderful, smells like I just made a batch of brownies"
5,2017-07-03,Too good! Love this scent!
5,2017-03-29,Recipient enjoyed this candle as a gift.
1,2021-12-08,"Everyone out there in Amazon Land take heed. Yankee Candles are not worth the money, you’re basically paying for the name. I bought 3 candles, had them lit for well over an hour and could barely pick up any scent other then the burning wicks. Granted some scents maybe stronger then others, but I’m not willing to take that chance.Will not purchase Yankee Candles again!"
5,2015-12-14,I can't get enough of this scent!
5,2017-11-03,Perfect for fall!
5,2017-08-11,Love it! Smells great!
5,2018-01-29,"great, they are so nice, thank you very much!!!"
5,2017-12-27,Best holiday candle!
5,2015-10-05,I mean how can you go wrong with yankee candle loved it
5,2017-12-13,A+
1,2019-11-27,"I am SO pissed. I ordered this as a gift to give TOMORROW. I JUST got it. Opened it right away...and the candle obviously had melted and been stored on it's side and hardened back up. It is totally pulled away from the side and the wax is all stuck to one side on the top. Now I not only have to waste time going to Kohls to send this back to Amazon, but I also have to try to find a replacement gift for my friend. THE NIGHT BEFORE THANKSGIVING!!! Super frustrated!!!"
5,2015-06-23,"Do you even need a review for a Yankee Candle?  I mean, come on, they are all awesome.  Stop reading reviews and buy it."
5,2018-04-24,"Ahhhh... Is that a chocolate cake baking? This candle is truly everything the description says & then add extra points for the BEST fragrance wafting through surrounding rooms of the awesomeness that is chocolate! Candles have burned evenly, lasts as long as they say and are heavenly to smell when you need a boost. Please, Yankee Candle, keep this one using same formula as it's truly the BEST smelling candle I've ever used. And trust me, I've got a closet full of half used candles that should be tossed out & perhaps will now that I've found one that makes the whole house smell like something special. Bonus: no calories with this chocolate layer cake! Just pure joy!Highly recommend!!!"
5,2018-04-24,Smells Great
5,2015-05-09,Makes a house a welcoming home!
5,2015-09-05,Great smells
5,2016-03-12,Great buy
5,2015-05-09,Delicious aroma!
5,2017-07-22,"A great bargain and smells great..( as long as people remember to keep the wick 1/4 inch) Otherwise, any candle would burn wrong and burn down the middle."
5,2016-07-13,Such a delicious scent!Oh...I get hungry :D
2,2020-08-21,"I got the vanilla cupcake scent as a gift for someone. I ended up keeping it—not because I liked it that much. The scent is disappointing. I don’t know about you, but to my nose, “vanilla cupcake” suggests sweet vanilla with warm sugary notes and a hint of buttery goodness. This is not that. This is no cupcake, all vanilla, and a generic, slightly weak vanilla at that. That’s a nice-looking cupcake on the label, though. I guess that’s where the cupcake part comes in...oh, well."
1,2021-11-30,I usually buy these more expensive Yankee candles because their smells are strong and can fill up my living room. This one and another I bought on here have absolutely no smell. You would have to literally put your face next to the candle to smell it and even then it's faint. Extremely disappointed and will not be buying again.
2,2021-09-04,"If you like a strong smelling candle, you'll like this more than I did. I like a light scent. This is very strong and gave me a headache real fast. And I was burning it in a very large open room. the scent itself (the pumpkin pie) smells good. It's just too strong for me. I might have to burn it outside on the patio in order to use it."
5,2015-03-05,This is my favorite candle!! I always have one in my house.
5,2016-07-13,Everything is perfect: The delivery and the candle. I love it.
5,2016-03-12,"I love this candle, I'll continue to reorder as long as there is stock."
5,2015-01-09,It's the perfect size and smells so good! Love it
5,2016-11-16,Very happy with candle & scent ordered.  5 stars.
5,2014-11-19,Great candle for the the price.
2,2021-10-04,"Yankee Candles was the reason I bought this and I was really excited to try this scent out. The bonus was that it was on sale. Although the candle itself is burning and lasting a long time, but I cannot really smell anything. I am known for my ability to smell things and I was very disappointed, but I will give them another chance. I’ve been buying Yankee products for years and will continue to do so."
5,2017-12-26,Some things you can get generic but candles is not one of them. This is the only brand to get
5,2016-04-24,I love it!!
5,2017-11-27,Loveeee
3,2020-09-16,I love Yankee candles but they are so expensive that I never get to buy any. So I was super excited when I found this French vanilla yankee candle on sale. The candle smells good but the scent isn’t as strong as it should be for a Yankee candle. For that I wasn’t impressed and probably won’t buy this scent again.
5,2015-03-03,Great vanilla scent and the two wicks burn nicely.  Very nice candle
1,2020-11-19,"Ordered five of these candles and four of them came this way as shown in the pictures I have attached to this review. It seems to me that these may have been subjected to extreme high heat conditions since they are so warped in shape within the glass container. No way am I able to find the wick within this wax, so I am forced to return these back to Amazon. Since this came from the Yankee company I was really expecting these to be exactly as you find them in the store, but I would wrong with that thought. Even though these seem to be a good deal especially with them being on sale the way they are, I will not buy these anymore through Amazon. I’ve already asked to have a full refund on the four defective candles."
5,2015-09-18,thought I ordered 2 but only received 1
1,2018-01-08,"I've always had good things to say about Yankee Candles because compared to other brands, I've consistently been able to depend on the scent of their candles being robust. I can't say that for this purchase. When you stick your nose next to the wax it smells wonderful and it would sure be great if that was the scent that it let off once the wicks are lit. There is no discernible scent AT ALL from this candle; to even barely detect it you need to have your nose right next to the burning wicks... and even then it's barely noticeable. So disappointing, especially given Yankee's cost. Makes me wonder if it's a counterfeit product? If so, the labeling sure fooled me. What an absolute DUD."
5,2018-05-27,This review is for the salted caramel candle.  Before I even got it out of the box I could smell it.  Couldn't wait to light it!  It has a great throw and burns evenly.  Smells just like caramel.  Warm and cozy scent.This review is for the Vanilla cupcake.  Bought the large tumbler.  Has almost no throw.  Disappointing.  Would not buy this one again
5,2016-07-16,Great candle thx.
5,2017-04-21,Good candle
3,2021-07-26,"Two arrived in the same package.  One was fine and the other in pieces.  It's actually the medium 2 wick tumbler but for some reason it's showing the jar which arrived in good condition.  When the jars arrived, they were packaged really well.  These came wrapped in bubble wrap in a flimsy paper envelope."
5,2021-09-17,"I purchased this large chocolate candle as a Christmas gift but because of its delicious chocolate scent I decided to keep it and burn it myself. Burns slow and clean, does not tunnel and sets off a decadent heavenly chocolate scent. One of the best chocolate candles I have ever purchased."
4,2020-08-17,"I bought two scents in the same order (french vanilla and steamed vanilla milk) but for some reason I can't leave 2 separate reviews. The former scent is fine, not very vanilla-y though; it smells very artificial and too waxy. The latter scent is amazing though. Especially when burning, the steamed milk candle is very sweet, and reminds me of cereal milk. Would recommend the 2nd, but not the 1st."
5,2019-07-18,I love the smell of this candle- makes my whole house smell wonderful - the first one i ordered glass was broken-- returned an had them send another one.  This one came melted an could not find the wick- let it cool down some an used a tool to dig in wax to find wick.  Really wanted to keep this candle or was not ordering another one in this middle Ga heat!  I found the wick an the wax was soft enough to shape it back close to normal as possible.  Kept it but wont order another one till winter.  Giving it 5 stars because salted caramel smells wonderful!!
5,2015-01-20,My wife loved it !!!
2,2021-12-07,I got 2 of these but I have to say - they really lack in scent. Not sure if I got an old batch or what but they weren't what I expected. I find that some Yankee candles just lack in general so that could be the case with this particular scent. Won't purchase again
5,2022-08-18,I have tried different companies' products for pumpkin scented candles but nothing compares to Village Candle Pumpkin Spice.  This is my favorite and now I've purchased one for me and one as a gift.
5,2018-12-11,"I can’t find this scent in stores this year or on the Yankee candle website. It smells like pine trees and peppercorns. Perfect for the Christmas season. I originally bought this candle in 2017 for the holidays. I loved it so much that I brought it to the bed and breakfast my husband and I got married at that December and it traveled with us when we went back home for Christmas. Every time I light this candle, it brings back all those great memories."
5,2016-05-18,I love it smells great.
5,2015-02-10,Smells amazing.. Right when I opened the box I could smell it.. delicious..It was a gift for my boyfriend's mother and she loves it.. She saves it because she doesnt want it to burn completely away. Great candle. Worth the price.
4,2021-08-24,This has a pleasant scent that is strong enough to kill odors quickly.  I only buy 2 wick.  I don't like that if you don't pay attention 2 columns burn straight down with high sides.  Have bought many candles of this brand.I prefer this wider opening to the other jars.
5,2019-12-12,"So in all fairness, this candle is great IF you like the scent. I ended up not being a fan of this particular scent, but the candle itself is great quality and HIGHLY scented. The jar yankee candles I’ve gotten recently all smelled like nothing, this one was the only good one so it’s a bummer I don’t like the scent. But if you have smelled in store and like it, definitely worth it :)"
5,2014-07-09,Love it!
5,2018-02-21,Nice packaging and this scent smells warm and sugery as though there is something baking.
5,2016-06-21,Smells great!
5,2020-09-22,"Scent is absolutely accurate.  Unfortunately, the box was damaged and the glass jar was broken into pieces.  I am so sad because the box smells so good.  I am getting a replacement.  But 2020.UPDATE: Amazon got another candle to me.  No damage to the glass this time.  I love the scent!  Would definitely recommend to fall scent loving peeps."
5,2012-01-05,"A+ no problems and arrived in timely manner, would deal again.That iis all I have to say about this item."
2,2020-09-28,"I bought the Pumpkin Pie scent and the smell upon opening the jar was nice but very light. Unfortunately there is absolutely NO smell or throw while burning. So disappointed I wasted nearly thirty bucks on this. It does burn fairly evenly and has lasted a good amount of time. I’ve been burning it all day every day for nearly a week and I’ve still got about 1/4 left, but it’s purely visual ambience as it adds zero scent to the room. At this point I’m just burning it down so I can get rid of it."
5,2015-08-12,Expensive but worth the dmell
5,2014-08-08,"The fragrance of this candle is pungent and appealing. However, the item arrived broken with no information of who to contact for a replacement. The lid should have been wrapped separately to protect the upper neck of the candle jar."
2,2020-12-30,"The description for these candles states that they are 2-wick medium tumblers that weigh 14.5 ounces. I ordered 3 of them thinking that it was a great price! Well, what I received is not what is described. They only weigh 7 ounces (half of those advertised) and there is only 1 wick. Be careful that you don't get bamboozled like I did."
4,2019-11-02,"I always get this scent from Yankee Candle, so the candle itself was fine, but both of the candles had melted some and leaked into the packaging and around the top, but it works fine. Maybe next time I’ll only order during the winter months."
5,2013-03-24,"I am very sensitive to any kind if artificial scents so rarely use scented candles. Yankee candles tend to be very strong so have thus far stayed away from them, however, this cinnamon candle is the only one that I have found to mask the smell of cigarette smoke and actually smell nice. I live in a 4-plex where we share an attic. My neighbor smokes and it comes in through my vents and fills my house with cigarette smoke smell. There's no opening windows in the winter in the northeast.Maybe it's the cinnamon specific smell, making this more like the scent of baking than artificial flowers or something but it is pleasant, strong and masking. I only have to light the candle for 5-10 minutes and that takes care of it.FYI, I also keep a candle in the bathroom. It doesn't even need to be lit. Just take the lid off and it is plenty strong enough to create a pleasant scent either in an isolated room or through out the house."
5,2014-12-25,Christmas gift
2,2022-05-11,Personally not fond of aroma.  I fear future pblms because wicks are so slender that the wax doesn't melt across the entire surface before candle light diminishes significantly.
5,2017-12-19,Who doesn't love a Yankee candle! this is a very nice fall smell!
5,2015-07-10,wonderful smell
1,2017-10-27,"Glad I bought 2 candles! Pumpkin Spice has NO scent while burning. Terrible. Now, my other candle: Fresh Roses - smalls AMAZING while burning! Disappointed with the Pumpkin; Glade pumpkin candles give off tons more than yours!"
5,2020-10-07,"Smells fantastic. Throws a pretty strong scent when lit, not overwhelming but noticeable. What's more surprising is that I actually catch a whiff of it walking by when its not even lit. The pumpkin spice is perfect for fall. Was supposed to take a couple of weeks to arrive but actually came in only a few days."
5,2017-02-08,The best candle you can pick different taste.
1,2021-08-27,dont buy candles are sent out in bags and come broken and a ball of melted wax I am going to return this hope no one gets cut all I can say big waste of time and money I cant gift it or use it thanks for my troubles prime time is becoming more problems i might just start going back to stores with this kind of help and service
5,2021-10-12,This candle…the best fall time candle! If I could put fall in a candle jar-this would capture it!
1,2019-11-07,"This was one of the worst candles I have ever purchased. Could not smell it at all. I will never buy anything from Yankee Candles again. After trying this candle, I feel like this company is completely over-rated. I basically just threw 23 bucks away...I'm completely disappointed. I should have just gone to Wal-mart."
5,2015-12-15,:)
1,2018-12-18,"I'm sure, and know very well that Yankee is expensive and of very high quality.Unfortunately the product at some point in time (maybe transit?) shifted all over the inside of the glass container it was in and left a heavy wax residue all over the inside. Not good, but the scent is second to none and I'm not going to return it.....this time."
5,2016-12-17,Nice fragrance
5,2016-09-05,Best candle ever! I can light Home Sweet Home all year in my house. Great price on Amazon as usual.
3,2015-04-06,"I purchased the 24oz version of this and loved it. It is well named in that sparkling cinnamon is the best way to describe the rich sharp cinnamon smell that is similar to a Red Hot or Mike and Ike candy. The Large Jar lasted for days during the holidays. I thought the Medium Candle with the double wicks would be similar. Unfortunately, the wick burns out with almost an INCH left in the container. In addition, the wicks were always lit at the same time but burned unevenly so one wick would still be lit while the other had extinguished.I will not buy this again and stick with the large jar."
5,2020-09-26,This candle is amazing.  Yankee candles last a super long time and are very fragrant and this one is no exception.  It smells like I baked a pumpkin pie.  It is wonderful!
5,2017-01-31,"sneaky kind of smelly thing, the wife loved it"
5,2017-07-17,Exactly as expected!
1,2019-12-21,Arrived shattered and I cut my hand opening the box-glass shards falling through cracks.
4,2022-02-15,"This scent is good, but, a bit too strong for my taste. It has a strong cinnamon scent. If you really like cinnamon, you will probably like it."
3,2020-11-21,"Yankee candles have been my favorite for more than 20 years. When I saw this great price, I jumped on it!  Now I am glad I only ordered one. It smelled wonderful until it got around the midway point. Now that it is half burned, I can barely smell the fragrance unless I lean over the top and really concentrate. It has been burning on an end table right next to me for the past two hours and nothing, no fragrance. So disappointing.  This candle is still long burning as are all Yankee candles, and it does not put out an off-putting waxy odor, but I will not buy this again."
5,2019-09-10,When I got this candle I immediately took the lid off. My whole house smelled amazing before i even lit it. It has such a yummy scent. This is definitely one of my favorite Yankee candles and i have quite a few. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!
1,2017-12-02,The candle has not smell at all and it cost more that the regular/original Yankee Candle Sparkling. I want a replacement with the original candle that has scent without charge.
1,2020-10-24,"I expected a warm, fall, pumpkin scent.....nothing. How??? No one in the family can smell when it’s burning. Hello quality control....."
1,2018-12-11,"What an expensive disappointment from Yankee Candle! Have usually been very satisfied with the candle scents.....until this time. No scent at all upon opening the ""jar"", but had high hopes for burning the candle. Absolutely NO scent. Come on Yankee Candle, these aren't cheap, and now I have 4 large candles that are only going to be useful during a power outage!Reading through numerous reviews that are also stating that their candles also have no scent, even one the day after mine, it seems there might be a problem! Would be helpful if someone would read this thread of negative reviews and offered a solution!"
5,2017-09-28,great
1,2021-11-20,"The scent is awesome with previous Large Tumbler Candle purchase; however did not have opportunity to enrich the scent with the Medium Tumbler Candle. Very poor packaging ~ No box or protection when shipped!  Arrived in many jingling, glass pieces  : ~("
3,2022-07-05,Was really dissappointed in all the 8 or 9 yankee candles i bought couldnt smell them unless you were right up on is usually  yankee candles are really strong smelling these were not.dont recommend them.sorry
5,2018-06-05,"I live in a 400 square foot apartment and sometimes dinner smells can take over, especially when cooking with garlic or olive oil. This candle does an excellent job making the air more tolerable. Lovely scent and the color matches my kitchen. Overall a great product from Yankee."
5,2021-11-22,"The scent is amazing!! I have never liked  candles with apple, pumpkin or cinnamon fragrances..This one is very light abd not sweet"
2,2017-12-18,"Tried this new fragrance as I have generally found Yankee Candle brand to be pleasing and long-lasting.  This version seems to be a flop!  After about ten hours of burning, there is still little or no discernible fragrance!  The best description is an odor of burning wick.  Perhaps my unit was the end of a run, but certainly not living up to my Yankee expectations or experience."
1,2020-12-06,"I buy Yankee candles because the smell has far beat any other candle, except for this one, it no smell at all. Not sure if I was given an old candle or if something went wrong in their quality control dept."
3,2021-02-22,"....and no, it’s not because of Covid, we smell fine. That just wasn’t a strong scent. It was very subtle. I prefer something that makes the whole room smell good. I won’t purchase this scent again."
1,2021-01-01,"After reading all the rave reviews about Yankee Candles, and loving Vanilla scented candles, I was extremely disappointed after spending $30 on a large French Vanilla Yankee candle, receiving it, lighting it, and smelling.......NOTHING. ZIP. Even when I put my nose right up to it, lit or unlit, I smell NOTHING. I usually buy the Woodwick Vanilla candles, which are phenomenal. I happened to have one stashed away, so got it out, lit it up, and the wonderful vanilla aroma filled the room, and the whole house.....along with the delightful fireplace-like crackle of a Woodwick candle. I am baffled by all the 5 star reviews, unless I just received a dud!!! Will be returning this one for sure!!"
1,2021-12-08,The only scent I notice is wax burning.  Normally Home Sweet Home is a very pleasing spicy scent. Nothing like that with this candle.
4,2021-03-09,"It's scent is a little peculiar. I ordered pumpkin spice and it smells like bubble gum and doctor pepper mixed, not sure if it's ment to smell like that. For a Yankee candle I was expecting it to smell like what it advertised."
5,2022-03-21,Kept my fingers crossed that it would arrive unbroken and it did.  Wonderful scent and good price.
1,2020-06-04,"I usually love Yankee Candles. I also like coconut and vanilla bean, BUT these do NOT smell like coconut and/or vanilla bean.  I really cannot describe the fragrance, but it's not good. I kept them because I had opened them and used them. DO NOT BUY."
1,2017-10-08,Candle took three weeks to arrive and when it did the wax was dried hard and the wicks wouldn't light. Returned it. Be wary.
5,2022-02-17,To enjoy the smell of coffee.  Everyone who comes to my home and smells this fragrance are buying this candle.  Makes the most appreciated gifts.
1,2021-09-07,"When lifting off the lid to this small size choc. yankee candle, I was Sooooooo happy. It smells just like chocolate. I figured WOW I hit the jack pot. Cant wait to order a bigger one.But wait,,,,,So I lit the candle and waited. AND waited, waited for a few hours....NOTHING.No scent at all.How can this be? What happened Mr or Mrs. seller? Where did the smell go?PLEASE GIVE ME A CHOCOLATE CANDLE THAT has a scent when I burn it, ok?Shipping with Prime was swift as usual. Thanks amazon. At least I know I can count on you."
5,2020-04-11,I just love the scent of this candle it lasts and lasts and lasts and you don't even have to light it you can just take the cover off and your whole house will smell like the scent of fresh baked cookies or butter but definitely of something homemade baking
5,2021-12-22,Are used to buy Yankee all the time this is the first time I bought one in a long time it is spiced pumpkin and you cannot even smell it very disappointed in Yankee.
5,2017-10-26,"I was worried about buying a new Yankee Candle scent online, but this Buttercream candle is really amazing. Smells exactly like sweet vanilla icing, so warm and light—but it's not sickeningly sweet or otherwise too potent. I definitely recommend this scent if you're a fan of vanilla. And as always, the quality of the candle itself is excellent. Well-packaged, high quality glass and lid, burns evenly, etc."
5,2021-10-28,Has always been my favorite yankee candle scent! Unable to find locally anymore. Arrived quickly and well packaged - very happy to find this scent as it will be a Christmas gift!
5,2022-05-03,"Awesome smell, not over powering. I will be ordering again in the future."
5,2019-12-24,A perfect size for smaller spaces when a full size is more than needed.  The vanilla smell is authentic and smells as though i am baking and does not fade.  It burns slowly and lasts a long time so it can be used more than once.  A simple design to fit in anywhere.
1,2019-01-30,"As other reviews have stated this candle DOES NOT have any form of scent whatsoever. Even putting my face right to the candle I smell nothing, absolutely nothing but the smell of a burning wick. Complete waste of money. I don’t know if this is fake or what but I am not happy I wasted so much money on a piece oh shi* candle"
1,2020-08-08,This is my favorite yankee candle scent and one of the few that doesn’t give me a headache.. the product I received is NOT the original Harvest scent. It is either old or fake. This is not the scent I paid for. Use caution when buying.
1,2020-10-27,"The scent is barely discernible, the shape is narrower and taller, and the wax looks totally different than the one I bought from the Yankee Candle store.  If this had been my first YC, I’d never buy another."
1,2020-10-13,This candle is TERRIBLE!! It smells good when you open it. But their is NO  SMELL when burning. Waste of money.
5,2022-03-28,Loved buying this candle. Smells great. Really makes the home smell better. 10/10 would recommend.
3,2019-07-27,"I love the smell of the candle.  But I was a little disappointed when it arrived, as it had been extremely hot and by the time I received it some of the oil and wax melted and stained the packaging with some wax in the glass top.  Im not returning as it is still burnable but am disappointed."
5,2021-12-28,The candle is beautiful. The scent is very nice. It looks very nice on my kitchen counter. Great quality.
3,2021-12-06,This was smaller than I thought would be...but smells great.  Much more orange than red .
3,2020-05-05,the scent is really weak. I burned the candle in a small room all day and the smell was barely observable. I will not buy it again.
5,2018-09-04,"I love this scent and burn it throughout the year.  I buy enough to keep me in stock since it is considered a seasonal scent.  But to me, it reminds me of a warm, comfy home with the smell of wonderful foods coming in from the kitchen.  Not only do I bar the large jar but I also like the tarts and stock up on them during the xmas/winter months."
5,2020-11-29,I personally love pumpkin spice. Not everyone does. This candle however is not to overwhelmingly pumpkin. The smell is the perfect mix of fall gourd and sweet desert.
5,2010-10-14,"I'm a big scented candle fan, and rarely do I find any candle that rivals the quality of the Yankee candle.  Yankee makes a consistent product that you can trust (even to purchase online).  This candle has the most crisp cinnamon scent--it's wonderful!  Of course, for those of you that are so inclined, it's been proven that cinnamon is a natural aphrodesiac for men, so light one up in the bedroom haha...I don't need to wait for Fall to enjoy a cinnamon candle--I like them all year long :)Yankee candles really DO last for the 100+ hours that they advertise--just be sure to follow the instructions (keep the wick short and be sure to put them out when  you're not enjoying them--the short sessions make for longer candle time--the long sessions use it up quicker per hour).Enjoy!"
5,2014-12-31,Used as a Christmas present.  She was very happy with it.
1,2018-11-07,I'm not convinced this is a true yankee candle... I cannot smell it at ALL and I've had it burning all day for 2 days now. I have had yankee before and always thought they were worth the $$... but this is the first time bought off of Amazon. Fake. Just go into the store!
5,2020-10-04,I guess it's hit or miss when it comes to people's reviews about the scent. It smells great and it isn't weak at all. I purchased this as a gift for a friend and I know she's going to love it.
3,2022-03-24,I love the smell of this candle but it has almost zero throw which is odd for yankee.
5,2020-10-05,This is the candle that started my obsession with the creamy smell of coconut and vanilla. It's so warm and soft smelling and fills the entire second floor with its deliciousness!!
1,2022-02-06,"I am so disappointed in these candles,the scent used to fill my whole house  with wonderful  scent the ones i recently bought barely scent my tiny  bathroom.I am stuck now with 3 expensive candles with very little smell.(no it isnt covid) Used to be a great place to get good candles now dont waste your money."
5,2022-01-27,The scent was nice and not to overpowering.  I like how the lid doubled as a small coaster to hold the candle.  The burn time was great for a small candle!  Will buy again!
5,2016-11-25,My wife like many women likes smelly candles.This one was reasonable priced and it has a nice smell. It doesn't over power like so many cheap candles can do.The jar is nice and the wick is lights easily.Would buy this again.
1,2020-09-24,Really disappointed with this candle.  Yankee Candle must have forgotten the pumpkin pie scent because there is no smell at all!  So much for the fall smell!  Surprised Yankee Candle would put a candle out like this to purchase!
5,2019-12-28,"My brother likes it for meditation and setting the scene for his girlfriend, that's all that matters.I think it STINKS... But I'm more of a vanilla girl myself.If you like pumpkin spice, it smells like pumpkin spice.My he said the scent is very rich and it's just what he wanted."
2,2021-04-18,Sent this item as a gift but she received the wrong item. A small 1-wick candle. Unfortunately I was unable to exchange it because she didn’t know it was supposed to be a larger candle and used it. Annoying that I didn’t get my money’s worth. If you’re gifting this product send it to yourself first so you can make sure it’s correct.
3,2020-11-17,"Smells great, haven’t burned it.  It has a long crack down the jar. I’m not going through the covid trouble to return it I think the label will keep it from leaking."
5,2018-04-20,Packaging was very well done...arrived just as though I got it from store shelf. And the candle itself is simply delightful!!! It REALLY does smell like a chocolate cake is baking in the oven. I will use this often and especially when entertaining!!! This candle is not for dieters hahahaha
5,2018-04-24,Smells like the best cinnamon
3,2018-08-12,"It got delivered before the expected date...really happyI smelled in dr.s office n ordered it,but unfortunately I couldn’t smell in my home the way I felt in  officeAnd earlier I used other brands,didn’t like much...thought good brand like yankee candle would be better...but little disappointed,thinking to check other flavour"
4,2018-09-18,"I purchased the large Yankee Candle jar in french vanilla, and it arrived speedily a day early. As soon as you pop the top, you instantly smell exactly what the candle has to offer.The wax stops right at the neck of the jar, so it was slightly awkward to light without a long neck lighter but I managed just fine. I have a fairly medium sized room so it took a couple minutes for the aroma to spread after I walked away, but once it did it was extremely pleasant.Turned off the light to see how well the flame lit the room on a cloudy day and I was actually pretty surprised. The illumination was faint but created a pretty nice atmosphere that was exactly what I was looking for.I definitely recommend!"
1,2020-02-23,The candle was old.  It had changed colors. And I it o amazon againhad no smell. I won’t be buying a yankee candle
5,2019-12-14,"I love Yankee candles in specifically love the cinnamon! I purchased them often and I purchased them from Amazon, they come securely wrapped I’ve never had one broken!"
5,2022-01-31,This double wicked candle lasted for a month used daily.  The caramel scent is spot on!
4,2022-04-03,"Overall pretty good scent but not as good as the new formula wax and real scents in other more modern company made candles. The wax smells strong sometimes over encompassing the scent. I will not buy these again because I can buy a better candle at a lower price at ALDIs!,,,"
3,2021-09-16,I love Yankee Candles but this one has too much smell for a small room.  It is overpowering.
3,2020-07-07,"I was so excited to receive this candle but upon arrival the smell was off. When I took off the lid it smelled like pancake syrup. I confirmed with family and friends that this candle smells nothing like buttercream and in fact just smells of syrup. Now, being a fan of yankee candle company for many years I am shocked to find that this formula has changed. Words just can't really describe how disappointed I am at not only the scent, but how much I spent on a candle that was suppose to bring back the sweet memories I had when lighting it. I am heartbroken."
4,2019-09-28,This scent is great for fall and smells just like pumpkin and cinnamon. Plus I got a great deal ($10.98)However whoever packed the box ruined the candle. The candle itself was wrapped well but when the packer put the 2 candles in the Amazon box they clearly did not pay attention to the image and words saying to keep the Yankee candle box upright (listed on every side of the box) and instead put them on their side. Needless to say the candles melted in the summer heat (luckily this pumpkin one stayed mostly intact except for the melted remnants around the rim/lid). My other candle did not fare as well. This is something Amazon should monitor as this issue could’ve been avoided. I also think for candles like this the Amazon box itself should say “fragile” and “this side up” so the delivery guys are also aware of this
5,2014-07-29,"Yankee Candle never fails to provide a consistent and wonderful product. Vanilla Lime is one of the greatest scents they have ever produced, and is my new go-to scent whenever I want to freshen up a room.Purchasing and shipping were a breeze, as it often is through Amazon, however I will give a fair warning: buying Yankee Candles online will never be a great idea if you don't immediately know what scent you're looking for. In order to choose new candles and not be disappointed I will always recommend at least visiting an actual Yankee Candle retailer. However, if you know what you want, this is a fantastic option."
5,2021-06-15,The small tumbler 7 oz and 2 wick large tumbler 22 oz fit perfectly in my hurricane marble candle holders!  Love these!
3,2020-11-24,I ordered Home Sweet Home. The sticker on the box said Home Sweet Home. The candle inside was Bahama Breeze. It's ok though because I like that one too. Lol
2,2021-11-29,Hardly any smell at all pretty much no smell at all that was a waste of money
5,2022-04-21,Great price and my sister-in-law loved it!
1,2018-03-27,"It’s been a few years since I’ve had a buttercream candle so I’m not sure when it changed... but I can’t smell it at all. Totally bummed, this was always my favorite! Feel like I really wasted money."
5,2021-01-26,I love this candle and will be buying it again and again. It smells like cinnamon and has that homey feeling I just can’t explain. I love it!
3,2020-01-20,I was looking for a cinnamon-ish smelling candle not quite Christmas and this looks like it fit the bill by the description. It is very very light scented and kind of nondescript sent with undertones of cinnamon.
5,2014-02-26,"the yankee candle smells great and last a long time.  Just one problem, it makes me hungry I would buy it again"
5,2021-03-16,"French vanilla scent is the one I was looking for. Great packaging, don’t know why there are bad reviews. Probably people live in hot weather that melts the wax. I received mine in mint conditions. I really like it and would recommend!"
5,2018-09-05,"I typically buy candles for my office (work from home) and burn them on a daily basis.  This candle has a pleasant scent to it.  I wasn't sure about buying it due that I had never smelled this candle prior (typically go to a Yankee Candle store to purchase my candles), but it all worked out great."
3,2022-02-03,I was expecting more candle for my $$
5,2022-07-20,nice smell
4,2022-05-20,"Bought this 3-wick Yankee vanilla candle for the first time and was a bit disappointed. Out of the box, the scent seemed nice & strong but after it was lit, the scent and throw of the fragrance diminished significantly. I also think I would have preferred a 2-wick on this candle, as opposed to the 3-wick it came with because it burned through much too quickly. Not one of my better experiences with Yankee."
4,2018-02-14,"My first review amazon wouldn’t allow to posted. I spoke the truth . Candle has very very very faint smell after burning for 30 minutes . However I am use to a scent that one can smell throughout the house I have small house. Perhaps this candle by yankee scent does not agree with my taste in scents. I have this burning in my kitchen.I need to revise my first rating. After leaving the candle to burn longer, I Went outside for awhile and when I came back in and opened the door , I smelled the scent. I think that in all fairness that I should revise my rating. However that being said, I think that it is just a nice light scent compared to what I am use to. I have for years favored another brand scent for years when I decided to give yankee a chance. The “smells like burning wax” is no longer true. It has a light scent, but I think that this particular scent just doesn’t work for me. I would give it as a gift"
1,2021-12-15,Zero smell. I ended up throwing it away. Will never buy Yankee candles again.
5,2020-12-18,We love this scent of Yankee Candles.  Have been purchasing it for several years.  The best price we've gotten it was on Amazon.  We will probably buy more from them.
2,2021-12-07,I purchased because the high reputation of Yankee Candle but the $10 target candles honestly are longer lasting and more aromatic than this
3,2022-01-10,"I never bought yankee candles because of the cost, This year for Christmas my husband wanted us to have them. I bought 3, 2 vannila and this cinnamon. The 2 Val. came in first I was so ready to light them and have my house smell like a cookie.. That didn't happen you could not smell them at all. When the cinnamon came in the glass jar was broken so i couldn't use it. They sent me another with no trouble but, when i got it it had no smell either... Very disapointed to pay that much and my 5 dollar walmart candles smelled better.."
5,2018-01-25,"Love the aroma of coconut with vanilla undertones. Some combos can be more than a bit ""overwhelming"", no such thing here. Light and fragrant. Glad my wife discovered the fragrance for us. Oh yeah....there's no smoke from the wick which just may be the best feature of all."
1,2017-12-18,customer service but something has happened to the quality of the yankee candles I bought. Used to one candle would smell up a huge area and now the scent is about 1/2 the strength. I bought these for christmas gifts but had I known they have messed with the strength of the scent I might as well have went to Dollar General or Walmart and got them for $5.00. Very disappointed. But amazon's customer service is the best. They really care about the satisfaction of their customers. This was not their fault.
3,2020-10-18,"Don’t ask my why, but when placed in a small room, smells fantastic. But when placed in a large living area, smells like burnt candy."
5,2021-07-20,The wife is happy with it. Probably would have liked a new dishwasher thou.
4,2018-01-01,"Smelled warm better than cold. First I thought it would be a very light scent, but it turned out to be really great when burnt. Caramel with the freshness of cheesecake. It is not so heavy like Macaron Treats, Snowflake Cookie or Christmas Cookie... still very sweet but with a fresh note to it."
5,2021-12-12,I love the last ability of the candles no matter what the size is
5,2022-02-26,Love the scent it's so different than the usual. I have gone through 4 large candles.
3,2021-09-06,I like the plug ins better for fragrance. Candle was ok.
4,2016-11-14,"They smell good. Not as nice as Leaves, in my opinion, but that's why leaves seems to always be sold out. They smell better lit than cold; they definitely have a ""fall"" kind of scent to them, the same kind of spicy warm smell that's in leaves. I like them as a 2nd place choice, and will probably order them again."
5,2022-02-16,My favorite
5,2020-05-29,Kitchen Spice is our favorite Yankee Candle scent. It is fragrant and noticeable when lit. Definitely recommend this one. Go for the large jar- you won’t regret.
5,2019-08-26,Smells delicious. I buy two per purchase for polar sides of the house. No one doesn’t not not not hate it. Usually lasts a couple weeks depending if you got company or are a loner which doesn’t matter because you will have this candle burning forever.
5,2021-03-24,"Exactly what I wanted, a light vanilla scent. I’m not one for scented candles as I’ve had terrible luck in the past but this one has an irresistible smell! I’ll be giving these as gifts, it’s that good!"
5,2011-08-12,Some people think that cinnamon candles are just for Christmas.  I disagree.  Cinnamon is a classic frangrance that makes your home feel homey and warm.  I'm constantly buying Yankee Candles cinnamon candles and I burn them all year round.  This is one of the best cinnamon candles there is.  I think you will enjoy it.  It makes your home smell like you've been baking cinnamon pastries all day...
5,2021-02-01,Nothing captures the sense of autumn in the countryside like this scent - has been my favorite for 2o years!
5,2015-08-19,"Wow, this smells absolutely delicious! Each time I light it I think of peach cobbler with a hint of cinnamon. Everybody sees, hears and smells differently but this is my opinion of the scent itself. The jar is built solid and doesn't get excessively hot when burning so it feels safe. If you can get it cheaper than the stores it's a great purchase."
3,2021-03-21,Definitely not as good as it used to be. I can spend $5 elsewhere and get the same thing.
2,2021-10-31,Smells good expected it to be larger very tiny candle .
1,2019-11-16,"Arrived slightly melted with the dye all over the packaging. First time I lite it, it was great but now there isn’t a smell. Buying in the store next time"
5,2022-05-04,Fills the room with a welcoming  scent
5,2021-01-15,Cinnamon and spice and everything nice.Helps my home feel warm and inviting. Love the long lasting scent of a yankee candle.
5,2021-04-20,"I'm eccentric about my candles. In my experience, most candles burn inefficient and lack any noticeable scent. This candle had a great aroma, and good, even, burn rate. I totally recommend investing a little bit more to enjoy a longer lasting great experience!"
3,2022-05-19,"The scent is very strong, you can smell it even though the top is on. Forget about lighting it, smells like burnt chocolate"
5,2021-10-14,"I alway prefer to see the actual flame of a candle inside its container (vs frosted/opaque glass) - this size, style, and gentle scent are ideal for autumn. 🍁"
5,2021-11-22,"Nice smell, good burning time."
3,2020-11-22,"Many years ago they were the best, but now, I'd rather use Colonial or Village, the smell is much more pronounced. Yankee has lost their edge, my opinion."
5,2021-11-03,"Love Yankee candles, they are the best"
5,2018-11-05,"Well i needed some light for my gaming setup, my friend said to try out some candles! I was not a candle person or ever cared for them, i ordered a few of them on Sunday and by Monday they were here. Very FAST Delivery, and it makes my room smell so good. I am now a candle person haha"
5,2020-02-22,Love this brand and this scent! My newest favorite so I ordered 2. I had to wait several weeks as they were out of stock when I ordered them. They must be quite popular.
5,2022-04-21,This is by far one of my favorite scents!!
5,2020-12-01,Love the smell and it smells good even after it's been burning for a while. Always a great idea for a gift.
5,2016-12-28,This candle smells so great I bought more for myself all and some to give as gifts.  The fragrance isn't too sweet or too strong.  It doesn't bother my family members who are sensitive to strong smells.  We warm ours in a candle warmer and it's a perfect fit.  The candle lasts longer than most.
5,2020-08-21,I Love yankee candles! They aren't always my favorite smells but they never smell bad! They last a lot longer than other brands.
4,2020-12-28,"Smells amazing! Burns faster than other candles I’m used to, but it’s cheap enough so not a big deal."
3,2021-10-14,"The scent is good if you like a really spicey aroma. I am not too happy about it but I hope the person I give it to likes the scent. Because it smells so spicey, I would recommend using it in a kitchen, breakfast room or dining room. I bought this to give to someone for a housewarming gift because the name of the candle is Home Sweet Home. I was very happy with the way this candle was packaged. It was wrapped very well in a shell of fitted cardboard and then boxed. It was delivered quickly and was completely intact, which is great because the candle is in a glass jar. I think this candle was too expensive, but I think all Yankee Candles are too expensive. I wish Yankee Candle would make more candle scents for housewarming gifts and name them accordingly."
1,2020-09-18,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 I apologize for such a long video, but I wanted to capture the candle shooting flames into the air. I bought 3 candles. The other two are excellent. However, this one “Home Sweet Home” just snaps, cracks, sizzles, and shoots flames out the top. That’s if I can get it lit.  I’ve NEVER seen a candle do this.  I’m so disappointed, because it actually does smell wonderful.  The first time I burned it, I had no problem."
3,2021-01-10,"Great scented candle.  Unfortunately, the glass broke in transit.  I was refunded without problems."
5,2020-12-02,This is my favorite scent. I like being able to get this delivered to my home so I am never without it.
5,2011-04-28,"The smell of this ONE candle fills my entire apartment.  Each of these candles lasts me about a month.  (I burn it daily.)  It really does smell like buttercream frosting.  When I was a teen, I was a docent in a Victorian house museum, and in June (wedding month), a beautiful, enormous, wedding cake was on display in the house (tiers of styrofoam covered with real buttercream frosting), so the whole house smelled delicious.  This candle reminds me of that."
5,2016-02-24,I had experienced the delightful aroma of this candle at a friends home and really wanted to buy one for my home. However all local sales outlets of Yankee Candles were without this specific scent.I was fortunate to find this scent at Amazon although at somewhat higher price than I had hoped to pay.However the pleasure I am deriving from the candle has proved worth the price.
5,2021-04-03,"this candle burns slowly, gradually infusing the room with a very welcoming scent."
1,2018-01-01,"It's my first Yankee candle with nearly no scent at all. I don't know if it is because of the 2-wick tumbler but I really don't get a scent whatsoever, even if I sit next to it and I have a very sensible nose. This was a huge disappointment. I bought this one in a 22 oz jar and hope it will have a better throw."
1,2020-09-24,I have several other candles being the same scent but this does not have any fragrance. Just a big brown lit candle
1,2020-12-22,"I was very disappointed in this candle. While lit, the candle does not produce any noticeable scent. I have purchased other Yankee candles which I was happy with."
4,2020-11-25,I have large open spaces in my house so its hard to smell across the room. Really love the scent though.
4,2020-12-06,"In appearance, the candle is excellent. I have almost burned it to the bottom, and I see no sign that the wick is going to disappear, as some people have reported.Unfortunately, the most important characteristic of a scented candle is the scent, and it’s much less than I hoped. I purchased the “sparkling cinnamon,“ and I can only smell it when I’m within a few feet of the candle. If I leave the house, I will notice it when I come back in, but it’s faint.I would not purchase this candle again."
5,2022-01-11,Overpriced for the size.
5,2022-01-12,Smells great
4,2022-04-04,"Price was great, candle was wrapped great came here intact. Of course Yankee Candle didn't have thir large size available & im sure it's going to be discontinued. (That's always My luck) Glad to have found it!"
5,2020-07-01,"I'm EXTREMELY SATISFIED With This Company. I Will Continue To Buy My ""FAVORITE"" Scented Candle From This Company For Sure!!!"
5,2021-12-21,Love Yankee candles.  Good quality.
5,2014-10-31,"Seriously decadent...I burn the candle for a while and I can live without ""needing to eat"" a piece of chocolate cake.  My son bought the candle, originally as a torture device for me, but it has worked in the opposite manner.  Mind you, the candle smells like a very decadent double chocolate cake!  It definitely is what it says."
4,2015-12-29,"Did not quite get the big aroma I was looking for but very nice does put out a nice smell.  Big jar, I like  a very strong smell and this smells nice just not a really big noticeable smell.  I gave 2 away for Xmas GIFTS.  Yankee just a nice candle Shipped Quick and very nicely and securely​ packaged."
5,2021-07-09,Love the smell of this candle!!!
5,2019-08-21,"WOW! Yankee never disappoints & this candle is no exception. The scent literally smells like a pumpkin pie is in the oven, I’m so in love with my new candle! Thank you A++++"
1,2019-11-17,Doesn't really smell.that well and I was disappointed very much because it was a yankee candle and I bought two because they smell.so good usually! So disappointed!!!
5,2019-01-06,"I bought two of these for Christmas, one for my sister's new RV and one for myself.  This is one of my most favorite scents of all time.  Love these candles!!!"
5,2018-12-28,I love this scent and used it for the holidays. Yankee candles can be pricey but worth it. I read some reviews regarding candles arriving messed up. This one was sent in original professional packaging. Very satisfied.
5,2020-07-30,Can’t go wrong with Yankee candles! The salted caramel scent smells SO good! Gave it as a gift to my grandma and she loves it.
5,2021-11-08,GREAT SCENT.. Had a pumpkin spice and coffee scent.. my kitchen smells AWESOME
5,2022-02-07,CHRISTMAS gift. Recipient enjoyed candle
2,2021-11-25,"I'm disappointed because normally Yankee Candle does a great job, but this had almost no scent, and I have a sensitive nose."
1,2020-06-08,"Completely misleading description:  Candle is 7oz, not 16oz.1 wick, not 2.Yankee Candle is conflating different descriptions and it’s not in the buyers favor.Tiny candle for $16.46 :-(Just say no!"
1,2020-10-04,I’m not sure it’s even a Yankee candle. It doesn’t smell like anything! No bargain here.
4,2018-12-20,"But like most, getting far too expensive. I mostly use other brands now that smell as good or better, larger and are longer lasting for the same price."
3,2022-01-05,Lovely candle with very little scent
5,2020-08-04,"I love it. The scent is very long lasting and within a few minutes of lighting it, the scent fills the room"
2,2021-04-04,"There was not much fragrance from this Yankee candle. I expected much more. I thought I was familiar with this brand, but this candle doesn't even fragrance a small room. It has to be burning for a while and you pretty much have to be on top of it in order to smell it at all. I was very disappointed in the quality. I admit that sometimes I burn it when I don't really care about fragrancing my home just to get rid of this thing. before burning it there was no way to tell that the scent would be so weak. if I could have returned it after I let it I would have. Pure integrity candles are superior, and even bath and body works candles were better than this one. I am officially ready to leave Yankee candle back in the 1990s."
2,2022-03-01,Very little scent
1,2019-04-14,"This candle is only good for when the lights go out. As for the vanilla scent...there isn't any. I'm really surprised because I have 2 other yankee candles right now that are very powerful. I've never had this issue with this brand. Although, this is the first time I've purchased one online. Maybe it's an online scam, like it's a regular candle and they slap on a yankee label. The other candles, that actually have a scent, I bought at Bed Bath & Beyond. Anyway, I spent $20 on nothing more than a candle to use when a storm knocks out the power. Waste of money."
4,2021-04-03,"I love the smell of cinnamon pine cones. So I thought I would try a cinnamon candle to try and give me that nice smell in the house. Well my kid's tell me it makes the house smell nice, but it wasn't strong in the cinnamon department. Nice candle, just not to strong on the fragrance. Thank you"
5,2021-04-24,One of my favorite summer fragrances from Yankee Candles!
5,2021-07-25,a mi novia le encanta
5,2021-07-10,Bought 2 during a lightning deal.  One came completely cracked and broken.  I submitted it on Amazon (super easy process) and within 2 days my replacement was here!  Very impressive
5,2020-12-02,Love this candle!  Smells so good.  Burns beautifully!  Will buy another!
5,2020-10-10,"This is by FAR my favourite candle by Yankee. The scent is a-ma-zing. I wish I had a house full of these (but I'd be broke as lets face it, no Yankee candle is cheap!). I love it so much I use it sparingly so it'll last longer."
5,2019-12-30,Bought this for my friend’s husband to give her as stocking stuffer. She loved them to fit the Engraved candle Holder he got her.
5,2019-03-12,Autum harvest is my favorite scent. The soy variety so much better than the wax candle because the scent continues to the last drop of burning and very little wasted wax with the soy.
4,2019-07-02,"I love this candle normally, but I used it on a warmer this time and I don't think the scent was as strong this way. I will still buy it, but just not for my warmer"
4,2020-12-12,"The scent of this candle is really good. However, this is what I have noticed. When burned in a smaller room, such as a bedroom, I find it to be overwhelming and just can not let it burn. When burned in a larger, more open area such as open floor plan kitchen/dining room/family room area, it's perfect. Bit of a scent, but not overpowering. So I will say I do like this candle, and would buy it again, but only burn it in a larger more open area of the house."
1,2020-03-21,Honestly has no smell and was super disappointment. Looks very waxy and has play-dough-y smell.
5,2014-02-04,"Great price for an actual Yankee Candle. And like all their products the smell is great. I live in the deep south, so I can only order these in the winter, but that's fine since the Fall smells are my favorite. Beware of ordering in the summer, I have read many reports of melted candles arriving.Arrived quickly, and in good condition."
2,2021-06-12,To small for price
5,2016-01-20,Smells great!
5,2019-08-01,"Candles can be really hit and miss as far as being able to really smell the candle while burning.We keep this one in the bathroom, with glass bottle matches and a stone next to it.It's an absolutely wonderful scent while burning."
4,2019-07-27,"While the scent is not strong, it is a nice scent. I light mine for a couple of hours each day, and I believe it will last approximately a month or so. I just wish the scent was stronger and more room filling"
1,2020-09-14,These candles USED to be amazing. Many difference scents I have bought are barely noticeable.  Disappointing.
3,2018-01-16,"I bought this as a 2-wick tumbler which was very weak in scent. The throw of the glas jar is a little better, but still not what I expect of Yankee Candle. The scent itself is very good, but the throw needs to improve."
5,2018-12-13,"This is my favorite scent from Yankee. We get it on the early fall months and with this size candle, it's lasted us all the way until Christmas. It smells fabulous and arrived well packaged."
1,2020-10-27,Doesn't smell!
5,2018-05-09,"When I was a kid, my nana always had an apple scented candle lit around her house. It became a comforting smell that reminded me of the crisp fall nights spent at her house. I’ve bought candles in the past, trying to find that similar apple scent. It wasn’t until I found this candle that I found that homely smell once again. Love it!"
1,2020-06-22,This is the second Yankee candle with this scent I've bought from Amazon.  The first one smelled great but this one doesn't have a scent at all.  I also bought Vanilla and it doesn't have a scent either.  Very disappointing.
5,2011-11-01,"I bought one of these as a gift for a friend, and then immediately decided I had to have one, too.Both candles were delivered in a timely fashion by the seller, and the fragrance was exactly what I'd hoped it would be.If you're accustomed to Yankee Candle Housewarmers, this is exactly the product  you've come to expect."
5,2020-11-23,Our favorite scent in the fall and for Thanksgiving
1,2020-11-23,No smell. Have burned for 2 days and all I can smell is the wax.  Don't  know when I will start smelling the scent of the candle.
5,2019-01-09,I was nervous buying a candle online in this cold northern Minnesota. When i got it in the mail it was perfectly packaged. I love the smell and shipping was super fast. I will buy more.
5,2022-01-18,"Smell good, look good perfect"
5,2019-05-23,I’m probably prejudiced because this is one of my favorite brands in a favorite scent-but they make a whole room smell lovely. And simple but not tacky looking.
4,2022-02-16,Scent is lovely.
5,2020-10-06,Apple Pumpkin is one of those tried and true scents of fall.  This is easily the most agreeable brand and scent in my house!
5,2022-04-27,Love my kitchen at Christmas to smell like Christmas and this is the ONLY one that does the job……I get so many compliments….
1,2020-09-21,The candle arrived melted to side of jar and wick was not visible - need to return
1,2020-12-01,"I love candles and I’ve heard Yankee candles are highly scented. Not true. I have better luck with Glade scented candles. When you enter or exit a room or my house, you can smell Glade candles. I would not recommend Yankee candles. Plus their pretty pricey. Go for Glade candles their only $5.00 and the  smell is wonderful."
2,2020-01-29,"First let me say that my wife and I are Yankee Candle lovers. It is the only brand of candles we purchase. Over the course of many years we have only had a few issues with their products.This was the first time we purchased the Sparkling Cinnamon scented candles which we wanted for the holidays and in regards to this variety they did not throw much scent at all, about halfway burned it started throwing a great deal of soot which was all over our coffee table and ,because of the double wicks, the candles burned twice as fast. This is a trick with every candle maker. The more wicks, the faster they burn and the more often you have to buy new candles. Please keep this in mind when buying candles.I would not recommend purchasing this particular holiday scent, but they have a great many of other high quality candles that we love. Our favorite is the single wick large pillar Midsummer Night scented candles. They give off a great deal of scent, that fragrance is wonderful (in our opinion-of course) and they last a month or more of daily use."
1,2019-10-27,"I like the color and scent, but the scent isn't as strong as yankee candle brand has been before."
3,2020-06-06,"Great scent, arrived within 24 hours..the only reason for 3 stars instead of 5 is because it arrived melted (as pictured), it was supposed to be a gift, but is not presentable, so I'll just use it in my jar warmer instead. I bought 2 Harvest, still waiting on arrival of second candle, hopefully it's not melted too....*note, I also purchased 2 other yankee scents (mistletoe) ,they arrived within 24 hours & are not melted...I mentioned that because its june, & all candles are not melted.*"
5,2021-03-30,I like the tumblers more than the jars.  I feel like they last longer and smell more throughout my home.
5,2021-05-17,Was a gift. They loved it. Smells great.
5,2020-11-27,This is my favorite candle it smells so good
4,2020-01-15,"Unfortunately, I could not smell the scent right from the beginning.That being stated, I am really not that disappointed as the price wasPhenomenal. Also, I have a candle lit constantly for tranquility andSpiritual reasons., from that standpoint, I would purchase againFor the longevity of candle burning. I have heard others stateThey would go directly to Yankee for this purchase;  I hope theyRealize they will be paying 3 times the price and probablyShipping too. I am staying with Amazon!👍👍"
1,2021-09-26,I am horribly disappointed. The candle came in a completely shattered container spewing glass everywhere as I attempted to open the box. My wife ordered this for herself as a Birthday present and is very upset to say the least.
1,2020-10-10,"I love candles and because I burn so many I wanted to branch out a bit and try something taht may have more longevity.  Definitely has longevity, but absolutely no scent...so disappointing as will not buy again..."
5,2022-01-05,Loved the way the scent lingers!Long lasting scent after several uses!Worth the buy!!
4,2018-12-05,Loved everything about this candle except it doesn't last near as long as other yankee candles I have bought.  I burned it for two days in a row (almost all day) and it was gone.
5,2019-08-30,The candle is great!  It smells wonderful and lasts a long time.I bought one for a friend and one for myself!  They make great gifts!
1,2019-09-19,Was received by USPS. Glass was broken and candle melted. This was going to be a gift but couldn’t use it!. Very disappointed.
1,2020-11-16,Next time I will buy directly from Yankee!
5,2015-02-28,"This is and has been one of my favorites for a long time. It is a very good scent no matter what time of year you are going to be using it. I guess I should say it smells especially nice in the winter when we are cooped up in the house due to cold, snowy weather as it brings in a breath of fresh scent to otherwise stale air....LOL"
1,2019-01-07,I bought two Yankee candle. They were sold by Amazon. Both were fake. Hardly any detectable fragrance. I have been using Yankee candles for years. These are not them!
5,2022-01-17,Perfect
1,2021-05-27,"The candle smells wonderful.  However, it arrived in a bag with no bubble wrap and was broken.  Refunded and ordered second that came in a box but was also broken."
1,2021-09-01,Must be fake if i can't even smell it
3,2017-12-29,"Would be 5 stars if it arrived intact. Glass was broken and cut my finger opening the package. Customer service made it right. Smells amazing so far, sad it's damaged!"
5,2020-08-30,You know yankee candle is going to be good.
5,2020-01-16,Just what I was looking for. I had been given this as a gift and was looking for a replacement.
1,2020-01-15,"Very very weak scent.  I was unable to smell much of anything when I opened the jar, and thought it would increase once it was lit.  It definately did not, and was not strong enough to smell when placed in a small bathroom for a couple hours.  I wish I hadn't lit it, otherwise I would have returned it.  Very disappointed, yankee candle french vanilla used to be one of my favorite scents."
5,2021-08-04,The warm richness of this candle is a recipe to relax and cuddle up with a good book and your favorite drink. One of my favorites
3,2018-05-24,"Too pricey because the scent isn't as strong as their giant sized candles of the same exact scent (which is one of my favorite Yankee scents). Not sure why that is, but it is disappointing."
5,2020-12-11,"Great smelling candle, but not too strong."
5,2020-10-09,Smells sooooo good and has lasted me months.
5,2022-05-02,Very full scent that smells edible and very much like a cupcake
5,2022-03-20,Great gift for family and friends
5,2018-12-07,"I usually do not like the “spice smells” but I purchased this for my boyfriends mother and I was TRULY surprised by the smell. It smells great! A little cinammon, a little clove, a little apple maybe?Good price, great smell."
5,2019-04-11,I love the salted caramel scent.  Why do they only release them in winter?  Doesn't Yankee Candle know the scent is wonderful all year long.
5,2020-07-21,Smells amazing and isn’t overbearing. Very good candle
5,2021-07-11,I absolutely love Yankee candles and I loved the scent the problem is the glass was broke in a lot of little pieces when it came in
5,2020-01-29,"My favorite scent,it sales out fast. Wish it would burn longer for the price and have more sizes and options for this scent."
1,2022-07-02,Arrived broken and I got a piece of glass in my finger as I took it out of the box. Be careful when opening!
5,2022-02-25,Christmas gift for my granddaughter.
1,2018-08-24,"There isnt even a hint of a scent, unfortunately i bought 6 based on the reviews & my love of yankee candles, but these are no more useful than a fake candle you can purchase for $3."
5,2021-10-02,Smells really good! Nice sweet smell!And it was packaged nicely when shipped!
2,2021-11-08,I couldn’t smell this. When I first got it it was cold and there was no smell. I thought it was due to the temperature. I let it get warm and burned and and still no smell. The jar is very pretty but I’m not going to burn a candle without the scent. Must be a defective one. I can’t believe they would all be this way.
5,2020-11-06,"Soft scent, wish it were just a bit more fragrant."
5,2019-01-03,Yankee candles burn very well. And have a very pleasing scent. They are not cheap – but if you know what you’re looking for they are worth their value.
1,2021-12-17,"Item arrived with ""open area on one half of candle"" . Upon inspection of box I found large piece of glass in bubble wrap. Unable to use product since one side of candle had no glass support."
1,2019-05-02,"I have been buying Yankee Candle buttercream for years now.  However, after ordering this one I noticed the scent has changed even though it is still marked buttercream.  It does not smell like buttercream at all and has a completely different scent.  It turns out Yankee Candle did change the scent.  I am very dissapointed and will not be buying this again."
5,2018-03-12,"LOVE this candle. I read people complaining about the size but it clearly tells you how big it is in description. It’s a yankee candle, they are expensive for a reason. I will buy again and again!"
4,2017-10-27,I really enjoy the smell of these - apple is the main note.  Each tea light burns out after 3-5 hrs I guess.  I've been using one each evening since they arrived.
2,2018-02-02,doesn’t have the well rounded scent of a bakery but smells more like a diabetic coma. go for the cupcake or buttercream or cookie candles instead.
5,2022-02-16,"Love this scent, it's not sold at the Yankee Stores anymore."
5,2015-09-03,"Best scent in my opinion. You can use this candle in your kitchen or in any room in the house and it smells great. Very welcoming, homey scent.....especially for the upcoming holiday season. I couldn't find this scent in the retail shop so I was thrilled to find it online."
5,2020-05-26,Outstanding product and seller will definitely order again
5,2013-06-06,"I've always loved this product and other scents from this company.  But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents.  Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles.  So, if I would have stayed with what I knew, I wouldn't have had to pay to have my walls cleaned and wasted money on a cheaper product.  ""You get what you pay for"" rings loudly for me.  Thanks for the excellent product."
4,2020-11-15,not particularly spice-scented.  pleasant and seasonal.
5,2019-12-16,Best candle Yankee sells. Smell it through whole house. Buy it every year. My favorite candle!
4,2017-06-12,"Watch ordering candles in warm weather. Little messy when they arrived. They were on their sides in the jars and a little bit leaky. After they set back up, they work AND smell good."
5,2019-04-04,"This was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend and it burned beautifully, smelled amazing and last awhile. Will buy more in the future"
5,2018-12-24,I’m partial to Yankee candles. I trust them to give off a lot of scent and burn long and all the way down. Haven’t been disappointed in one yet.
4,2018-11-29,"For quite a while it seemed, the Spiced Pumpkin candle was not as strong or pleasant as the first couple of yrs it was out.  I've been buying Yankee Candles since the catalog days and the store in Mass, so the scent was markedly different.  I tried it on and off for years, and then decided to try it again after a number of years.  I'm happy to report that at least with the jar I received, the scent seems to be back - as good as before.  Spiced Pumpkin is one of my all time fave scents."
3,2020-02-28,Smells good but not strong. B&BW smell a lot stronger. Not worth the price.
4,2017-10-27,"This Yankee candle has a very nice scent, but it could be a bit stronger. I've almost exclusively bought Yankee for many years and this is the first one that has a scent that is very subtle. If that's what you're looking for in this scent, you'll like this candle. The preference for a stronger scent that fills several rooms is my own."
5,2019-03-19,"My wife likes to burn these all year, not just for the holidays.  Nice to be able to find them on line.  Just want she wanted."
5,2019-10-25,I love this scent. Yankee Candle hasn't had any for a while. I finally found one here.
5,2018-01-27,this candle is awesome...it has a warm inviting smell that envelopes my whole apartment.it does not lose is scent and never too strong
3,2019-07-06,"2nd day of having it lit, and it's already starting to pool more in the middle, and not melting evenly around the sides."
1,2020-07-16,"The product came completely ruined and melted. I opened it and it is literally dripping. It is so ruined, that I can’t even see the wick.... I’m very disappointed; even more when spending $25!"
1,2020-10-24,This candle has no scent at all.
3,2016-01-18,The pumpkin spice smell just wasn't there.  I was surprised it being a Yankee Candle and not having a stronger smell.  I thought the smell would go throughout room but you had to get inches away before you could smell it.
5,2018-09-26,I love the scent and so far one candle burned 99 hrs (I kept track).  This 12 oz size is so perfect for me that I bought two of these.  Recommend!
5,2011-10-04,"Home is where Mom bakes pies... I love candles that smell like I've been slaving away in the kitchen all day.  Something about this pumpkin pie candle makes my house feel more ""homey.""  This is by far my favorite candle scent.  I burn this candle, not just in the fall, but all year round."
2,2020-10-25,"I see people saying it has no scent. Well the one I got had a scent, but it smelled like bubble gum. I guess that's what people at yankee candle think pumpkin spice smells like."
4,2019-04-06,"I normally buy the 3-wick candles from bath and body works. Compared to those candles, this candle had a very weak scent. That said, since the candle had quite a long life, I had time to get used to the scent that was not quite as powerful. It is a very pleasant smell, but I just took one star off since it was not as strong as I would have liked. I kept the other four stars on though since it was quite a bit less expensive than the bath and body works candles."
5,2019-03-26,I can definitely smell the fragrance when the candle is burning but it is not overpowering. It smells like lime and vanilla just as the description states. Love it!
5,2020-08-16,Love this scent for Fall!
3,2022-03-23,"I used to really love the Buttercream scented Yankee Candles. This candle is not the original scent. It is now overwhelmingly caramel with a much softer frosting smell. It's also super strong, and I can only burn it briefly before I need to blow it out. I am so disappointed because I was so happy to find this discontinued scent. I wish I could get the original scent again. I have been buying Yankee Candles since the 1980s when Country Heather was popular. They really have changed."
5,2021-02-27,"Pricy, otherwise love"
2,2019-05-10,"...the scent is very weak...huh, used to this brand being highly scented (especially this particular scent)..."
1,2018-08-24,"My candle came warped, but I decided to try one because the reviews were so good, & there is no scent, no one in my home can smell anything when we use it."
5,2020-06-30,Great candle with amazing scent!
3,2021-08-23,I'm not sure if these are genuine yankee candles or just old but they seem very inconsistent in the condition they arrive in. This particular candle arrived with one side kinda melted and the oil had leaked out all over the jar and lid. We were able to salvage it but please keep in mind it will be a case by case with the condition of these candles. The scent is lovely. It smells just like chocolate. I do find that it's detectable in a large room but not to the extend I'd like it to be. They also don't last very long for me.
5,2019-04-04,This is such a great candle! The scent is fantastic without being too overbearing. It is worth every penny!
3,2021-01-10,Honestly if you are not in the same room you can not smell anywhere else. Disappointing asi love this as a holiday scent.****UPDATE. I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT 2 CANDLES. MY FIRST REVIEW WAS FOR THE FIRST ONE. TODAY I DECIDEDTO TRY THE 2ND ONE BEFORE SENDING BACK AND IT SMELLS SO GOOD. MY WHOLE FAMILY COMMENTEDON IT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY ONE CANDLE HAD POOR THROW AND ANOTHER SAME CANDLE HAD WONDERFUL THROW AND SMELL
5,2020-05-29,My wife buys these and we love them.
5,2017-08-18,"I absolutely am sold on this one, Caremel Apple Cake. Its a delishous smell that attracts many ppl. Its almost like I'm really making a Caramel Apple Cake in my home. I recommend this and I WILL buy it again."
5,2019-10-24,This is my favorite Yankee fragrance.  It smells sweet and savory! I use it all fall!
5,2018-06-30,Omg it smells great!!!Even before opening the box i was already smelling the salted caramel!!!O will buy it again and will 100% recommend it to others 👌🏻
5,2018-09-06,Can't beat Yankee Candle.  Burns down evenly.  Doesn't leave a bunch of wax on the sides of the jar.  The very best brand you can purchase.
5,2016-03-19,"Potent candle, This scent is long lasting and very aromatic. Many scented candles at the drugstore lack any real scent, or are too weak to even notice. Not with Yankee Candles, You get your moneys worth"
2,2019-11-05,"I specifically ordered the medium jar candle to fit a pumpkin shaped candle holder I have, and they sent me a large jar. I guess I'll just have to go to the yankee candle store to get what I need. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does smell nice"
4,2021-05-13,This is an incredibly delicious scent. It can be pretty torturous when you’re hungry. That happened to me when I lit this up in the morning when I started my work and I was hungry in just couple hours. Hahha! The throw is pretty decent. The delivery reached me pretty safely and on time so I’m glad overall.  4/5 stars coz the throw was not as incredible as I had excepted it to be. It can fill up a small room pretty quickly but may take couple hours to work it’s way up in larger spaces.
3,2015-07-07,"This is a wonderful smelling candle. It does not smell to sweet and is not over powering. I can only give three stars because it does not put out a great deal of smell. If you get within two or three feet of it you can smell it, but it did not make my apartment smell nice."
3,2022-06-29,"Bought this candle because I was at someone's house and had to ask what they were burning. Smells GREAT. The only issue I had was that the wick was not centered and, as a result, the burning was not even and the black ring had to keep being wiped off the glass, the glass turned so it would melt evenly, etc. I would have returned when I received it, but wanted to freshen up the place. However, now that I've been using, I kinda wish I'd taken the time to exchange. However, the smell is truly amazing."
5,2020-01-03,Nice candle. Dual wicks. Smells like grandma’s kitchen. Awesome.
5,2013-03-11,"Great smell, stays lingering even without the candle lit! Not the full size one, but it isn't the smallest one either. Worth the price, it hasn't burned down past the neck yet, and it has been used probably 10 times or so already. Would definitly buy again."
5,2021-01-08,"It's so relaxing to smell this, I've never smelled this type of candle but it's lovely~"
5,2020-06-29,"Great scent, very autumn like."
5,2019-01-26,"I've been in LOVE with this scent for about 2 years now. I bought it as a gift from ROSS or HOMEGOODS. i loved it so much. it's hard to find.it gives a warm by the fire feel, and leave the whole house smelling amazing"
5,2019-08-14,This Spiced Pumpkin candle smells wonderful! One of Yankee Candle's best product.
5,2020-01-11,"I'm a big fan of Yankee candles, did not disappoint, so love this scent!"
3,2020-11-07,"I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about the Yankee Candles not being authentic on Amazon, but figured I would try them since it was on sale. I wasn’t the biggest fan of this particular scent (Salted Caramel)  and it wasn’t very strong like some of them are. It did take a long time to burn which is something I appreciate since candles are so expensive. If you like the scent and prefer something more mild in terms of potency, I would recommend."
5,2018-03-27,"This candle is heavenly! Scent is a strong enough to fragrance part of my home and the baking overtures are just heavenly. Will buy again, for sure."
3,2016-06-06,"Scent was nothing like pumpkin or buttercream.  I love the Yankee spiced pumpkin and vanilla/icing/....etc types of scents.  This was nothing like any of them.  I wanted to try this new scent, so I did.  Not for me."
5,2020-09-23,"My absolutely favorite Fall candle!! The sugary pumpkin scent fills up my entire apartment, the perfect blend of sweet and spice.  Shipped very quickly, too!"
4,2021-03-25,"It smells nice and lasts a decent amount of time, but you’re partially paying for the brand. You can get a candle that smells just as nice and lasts a bit longer for $5-$10 less, and if you use scented candles a lot that adds up fast. I still buy this one semi-regularly because my mom loves this brand/scent in particular and it’s an extra few dollars to make her happy, but otherwise I don’t think it would be quite worth it."
1,2019-10-02,I purchased this on Prime Day 2019 for a Christmas gift. I finally got around to opening the Yankee Candle box this week and realized that this product is defective. Not sure what I am going to do with it now. I am upset that they sent a defective product and now it is too late to return it.Warning: Be sure to open the box and examine your candle as soon as it arrives just in case it is defective and you need to return it.
5,2019-03-01,Great product. Makes my entire bathroom smell wonderful even when it’s not burning. Lasts a long time!
3,2020-11-23,No-name candles I buy from my local grocery store for the fraction of the price are more fragrant when lit than this one. I was looking forward to my tiny apartment smelling like fall—super disappointed!
5,2018-12-08,I wish it was like the old days where they made candles that lasted a couple of days instead of just a few hours.
5,2019-12-05,I'm Really Impressed. My FAVORITE Christmas Candle !!!
5,2020-11-24,affordable and the best
1,2022-02-28,It has no scent waste of money can I return
4,2019-12-22,"They burn for a reasonable amount of time. I bought a new tea light stand (3 hanging iron pumpkins) and they complete the look when lit, and a very nice scent. Very pleased."
5,2020-01-21,The most yummy scented candle I've ever had.  Everyone that walked into my home entryway immediately thought I had  a warm platter of butterscotch cookies just out of the oven and waiting for them!  I ended up ordering several more of this candle for xmas gifts and more for myself.
1,2020-10-29,Candle has no scent at all. Let it burn for over an hour and the candle give off no scent at all. Not worth the 20+ spent. Yankee candle is not what it used to be.
3,2020-09-18,"It also seems that it will only last that long IF it isn't burned CONTINUOUSLY for that amount of time.  The candle needs to rest and reset for it to last that long. I'm not impressed by the scent, but then again, I much prefer earthy or floral scents over food or spice flavored scents.  So vanilla cupcake, cinnamon stick, cookie dough or other such nonsense is not my thing in a candle.  By far my favorite is Yankee's Balsam and Fir. Now that's a candle!  Lavender? YES.  This cinnamon stick is rather weak, just a meager hint of something old in the oven but is is cinnamon? hmmm. not sure.  Could be a baked potato"
5,2020-06-18,Wonderful!!
5,2021-12-18,Agift
1,2020-09-29,I guess I’ll have to use it with a warmer... no wicks to light. Smells good tho.
5,2020-01-05,Loved the fragrance for my daughter.
4,2020-02-22,Smells nice and made a great gift!
5,2016-03-08,This was the best choice for me.  I did smell the other combos and found them overwhelming for me.  This candle was sooth with a light creamy pumpkin pie smell.  I also prefer the shape of the jar.  Highly recommend this candle.
4,2020-07-09,"The candle and the scent are great.  When I opened the package, it appeared that the candle had melted to one side.  The wick was buried in the wax.  I had to dig out the wick and make a canal for the melted wax to drain, because the accumulating wax extinguished the flame.  It seems to be OK now, but I had to watch it, and tilt it to drain it, for the first couple of hours."
2,2019-07-25,I got this candle a few days ago and I am disappointed that it hardly gives off a smell.  I wouldn't buy it again.
4,2022-03-15,"I'm not really a candle person but I LOVE the scent of this one.  It really does smell like chocolate cake cooking in the oven!  Unfortunately, the size is much smaller than the option that used to be offered."
5,2018-12-14,Yankee candle comes through again.  I like this size; the scent is delightful & the price is just right
5,2017-11-05,This is one of the best Yankee Candles I have ever had. Fragrance lasts so long. It smells as if you are in a tropical island. Love it!
1,2015-10-14,"Arrived sticky with globs of orange oily- stuff stuck to the outside of the jar and also the seal between the lid and base. It was difficult to wash off and also forced me to remove the label because the label was too damaged. The seal is still orange.Additionally, it gives off a lot of black smoke when it burns - I found myself blowing out black snot after being in the room with this candle for a few hours. On top of that, the black-snot incident was weeks ago and my house still reeks of this candle, despite not having burned it again. Stinky sticky nasty candle."
5,2021-09-06,I love this particular scent. I am disappointed that this candle has lost its frangrance
1,2018-05-23,Smells great but it came as a melted mess with broken glass. Waste of money.
5,2020-12-28,Love
5,2017-03-06,THE BEST
5,2019-03-17,I bought two of these right after Christmas when price was discounted -- love the fragrance - wish I had bought more!
5,2019-12-14,Yankee Candles are always a great gift choice.
5,2019-06-15,"Got for my candle-loving roommate. Smells good, not overwhelming."
5,2020-04-13,Love the scent perfect for the kitchen.
5,2019-04-11,What a refreshing smell...just what we needed!  Yankee Candles are the best!
5,2020-02-03,"Very nice scent, and burns great"
5,2020-12-26,My favorite Yankee candle scent.
2,2017-09-26,"My previous experience with Yankee Candle Company was excellent, but this candle doesn't have a scent at all."
5,2018-08-19,The smell is perfect for small spaces. I give it a little shake once in a while to wake the scent. Not overwhelming.
2,2019-04-16,"Candle smells like it would smell really good when lit but when I received it, it was completely shattered in the box :("
1,2019-12-19,So far soooooo weak... I Bought this today and it has burned for 4 hours and I CAN'T SMELL IT... Waste of money.
5,2020-01-18,Good product fast delivery
5,2021-01-06,This is my all time favorite flavor
1,2021-11-10,Can not smell the candle. It smells like a candle with no smell. Would like to send back and get different one would like a different one.a xmas smell
5,2020-10-25,The candle smells great but the only problem is the glass  was broken on both. I still used them but will not order again
3,2022-04-23,"I usually love these candles because they burn great, but the last one I received burned very poorly.  There was still a ton of wax when the candle was used up. It burned more like a cheap candle.  Very disappointed."
3,2018-03-25,"The scent is very light but it's a pleasant cinnamon smell.  I would recommend the candle for a very small room, or bathroom."
5,2020-07-29,I sure hope this becomes available again! Love this scent!
3,2021-08-09,It completely melted and turned solid again rendering it useless. I wasn’t home when it arrived but my roommate was so I KNOW it wasn’t because we left it out too long. (Her dog is an alarm and let’s us know when people come on our porch). I’m disappointed and returning. I love the smell so much that I want to get another but I don’t want the same thing to happen.
1,2018-01-08,Zero scent what so ever.  So disappointed in this candle.  You literally need to hover your face directly over the candle and wave the scent towards your face to get the slightest inclination that it’s a scented candle.
5,2019-09-27,"It’s yankee, can’t get much better darlin."
5,2018-05-14,I got these at an unbelievable price and they make the entire house smell like you are baking a chocolate cake.
5,2020-02-26,Need I say more!
5,2022-01-17,"This was a gift for my mom. She loves it, the candle makes her entire house smell like a bakery!"
4,2022-01-19,"I like these candles, but I wish they maybe had two wicks in them. It doesn't burn evenly and the scent didn't last as long as expected so halfway through the candle, it's tunneling and not as strong of a scent."
5,2017-05-10,"Yankee candles are the best, and, in my opinion, this is one of the best fragrances sold.  I have purchased them repeatedly."
5,2020-05-28,"as a fan of all things sweet (and candles), i knew i had to have this. the candle is a good size so it'll last you awhile and the smell is rich, but not too overwhelming. i bought this to dull out the smell of my dog in my room lol (stinky boy), and it works!"
5,2019-04-14,Candle smells great and lasts a very long time. Very pleased!
2,2019-02-15,Glass candle came broken in shipment. Shattered glass in package when received
5,2014-06-11,I love this fragrance!  I can not tolerate most candle fragrances so I was really happy to find this vanilla lime here.  It is not available in the store where I first purchased it.  Hopefully they continue to carry it!
5,2019-03-31,Love the scent of this candle and am glad it was available via Amazon.
5,2020-01-17,it was a Xmas  gift
5,2014-12-14,"Yankee Candle's Harvest scent is my all time favorite candle scent. We can use one of these 2-wicks up in about 2 weeks - so we are limiting burning of the 2nd one. They arrived in a timely fashion, packed well."
5,2020-01-27,Lovely smell and stays fresh all day
3,2020-01-06,Not to bad
5,2019-11-23,Girlfriend loved it
5,2020-05-16,Loved the candle!! Love the smell!!
4,2020-11-28,"Smells quite nice. It takes about an hour for the scent to really start spreading. Yankee candles usually last significantly longer than cheaper candles, which is a bonus. The scent is strong enough to be noticed upstairs while I burn it on the main level, but is not overbearing when sitting nearby. Product is as advertised."
2,2019-05-11,Ordered this for my mom for Mother’s Day. The package was fine but the candle itself was broken!!!!! It’s still usable but it’s still disappointing. I was going to order one for myself but not anymore.
3,2019-12-08,Not much sent
5,2018-02-16,Fantastic scent.  Just like the Yankee candle I would buy at my local card or craft store.  Good quality.  No complaints.
5,2019-12-27,My most favorite scent
5,2018-03-20,I bought this Yankee scented candle about a year ago.  I loved the scent it so much I wanted to buy another one.
5,2019-01-24,I love this scent. I received one as a gift and ended up purchasing another. Perfect for fall!
5,2020-10-07,This candle came wrapped really well. I was a little hesitant to order after seeing some of the broken candles arrive to others. The scent is perfect and not over powering. Great for the holidays. Enjoy!
3,2022-08-07,"The smell is very light and my room is 150 sq ft, the smell comes and goes :/ it’s not too strong but you can smell it every now and then which I want a strong candle, it melts pretty fast too maybe I got a bad candle lol 😭 but it’s good, smells more cinnamony with pumpkin 🎃"
5,2018-03-29,"While I don't like the smell of salted caramel, the friend I bought this candle for LOVES IT!  You can't go wrong with Yankee Candle as long as you know the scent you are buying."
5,2018-11-02,"I like these year round, my wife will not let me. It is like a smell of the fall"
5,2019-11-12,Omg love this scent!
1,2021-12-21,There was absolutely no scent!  I will never buy Yankee candles again!  Waste of money!!!  Highly disappointed!!!
5,2018-12-24,"Just as expected, great product, wonderful delivery and all is well, Thanks."
4,2021-01-06,It smells great but it does not smell very strong while lit. Yankee candles are always quality candles. It burns evenly and will last for weeks if burned and maintained properly. I have a smaller home and the scent barely noticable after hours of being lit unless you stand right next to the candle.
4,2019-05-11,Very strong scented candle.  Almost too strong.
4,2022-04-05,"Like all Yankee Candles, we got long use out of this candle. Loved the scent! Lavender plus a nice woodsy tone makes this one of my favorites. I wish the scent had filled our living room a bit more, but it’s perfect for a bathroom or smaller area!"
5,2018-06-18,This candle is amazing it burns so nice and slow and the amazing smell it fills the room with is so amazing it smells just like a Carmel apple pie fresh out of the oven its pretty crazy.
5,2019-12-21,Nice candle
1,2018-11-24,Was not what was advertised.  returning.
5,2019-08-20,I.love it the scent is perfect !
2,2022-05-05,Yankee candles are the best have been buying them for years for whatever reason this one I received with the cinnamon stick smell did not match that description at all it might have been a production problem on that candle alone had to return it otherwise I would always buy Yankee candles.
3,2020-09-24,"I specifically ordered this because it was supposed to smell like real cinnamon. Sadly, it has more of a clove scented base. I got tired of buying cinnamon scented pine cones and I wanted something that lasted longer than they do. Unfortunately I'm just not a fan of the candle like I was hoping I would be. Seems to last awhile, but the scent is not close enough to genuine cinnamon for my liking."
5,2018-11-03,This non smoke emitting candle has a wonderful smell and lasts a long time!
1,2018-12-21,Top one third of the glass jar was broken.
4,2019-07-02,Can’t ever go wrong with Yankee Candle.
4,2017-04-06,"First time to try this scent and I really enjoy it. I love pumpkin and I love buttercream, I just get hungry when the scent fills the house."
5,2017-11-20,Awesome smell!  Smells like the oranges we used to spike with cloves when we were kids.
1,2018-04-13,These must be a second or third level as they are not fregrant at all.  This brand  typically burns Arron which is why I placed this order.  I will not be ordering again.
5,2019-10-21,Smells incredible
1,2021-10-29,Also bought 2 in Sept. for Christmas gifts because we all loved the smell of previous ones.  Poor Yankee quality or a fake?
4,2016-03-14,"I didn't care for the smell (vanilla bourbon) on this one, but these are good candles.  They last a long time and are well packaged.  I like the glass lid on the top."
5,2021-11-03,Actually smells like salted caramel.  Have bought this flavor before and will again.
5,2019-08-29,My favorite candles
5,2019-05-02,"Waited all year for this scent to find its way back into stores for the 2018 holiday season with no luck! This is the best ""homey"" scent ever made!"
4,2019-02-24,The scent of this candle is wonderful. I only gave it less stars because it becomes very hot and the glass broke. It’s important to remember to not keep it lit a long time. Definitely I would keep it away from children. When it’s on sale I am going to buy it again. Another issue is that it only burns about 3/4 the way down. That’s a bummer. Yet I still like it and will probably purchase again. Thank you Amazon.com
5,2015-01-08,"Best candle scent EVER!!! Smells like u are at the beach......actually, smells like the cocktail u should b drinking at the beach, not sweet, not overpowering, just banana-y goodness!!!!"
4,2021-10-18,I love the smell of this candle. I just wish that I was able to find the wick so that I could light it. Somewhere along the line it was stored on its side and melted as you can see in the picture.
5,2018-02-26,"Candle burns wax evenly, smells amazing, and lasts a long time! Good quality!"
5,2018-04-15,"What a great deal for this candle!  It smells so good, and looks very expensive, and it is every bit as nice as the ones I've seen for 25 or $30! It's a great buy."
3,2018-10-29,Not really a strong scent of Cinnamon ... difficult to distinguish.
2,2022-02-14,"I agree with other reviews about the wavering quality standards for Yankee Candles. This and other Yankee Candles previously had wonderful scents that were very aromatic and filled our entire home. This candle is very weak and has virtually no noticeable scent. I have had the same experience with other Yankee Candles as well. Yankee Candles changed from strong aromas to weak and nearly scentless. I recently bought very-strongly-scented 24oz jar candles from Goose Creek Candles (Angel Food Cake, Banana Nut Muffin, Carrot Cake), all of which are wonderful and fill our home with great aromas. Goose Creek Candles are much stronger and more aromatic."
5,2020-01-01,Perfect no complaints
4,2018-01-16,"I love all pumpkin scents. I expected a sweater pumpkin scent which it wasn't, still a very good one which I would recommend."
5,2017-12-12,"You can't go wrong with yankee candles.  Period, the smells linger and are superior to other candles."
5,2018-11-16,Good smell.
5,2019-12-21,Excellent
5,2019-05-29,Yankee candles always smell great and last for a very long time!!
5,2020-01-20,Love it
5,2021-01-10,"Very good,  everyone loved them."
5,2018-07-22,Best smelling yankee candle. Smells like you are baking chocolate cake.
5,2018-10-09,Smells so GOOD! And fast shipping! And Jar doesn’t break when it delivered.
5,2018-11-05,I love this candle and it does not disappoint. Can make the biggest of rooms smell fantastic!
5,2016-08-15,My favorite Yankee Candle.
5,2018-09-13,Great housewarming gift for a new home owner.  The scent is lovely.
3,2020-01-29,I've always been a big fan of Yankee Candles and I was surprised that when I opened the delivery box the lip around the candle was broken. If I tape it just right I'll still be able to use it. But I was disappointed hence the three star rating and one star because you can't give a broken gift to anyone. Had it not been broken it would be a 5-star rating becauseThese candles are amazing. They last a really long time typically and I don't know how long it's going to last if it's broken I don't know if some of it will leak out or whatever. These candles are typically excellent
5,2018-04-30,"Amazing, cozy scent. Perfect for fall and winter. One of the stronger Yankee candles."
1,2017-06-07,The aroma is pretty poor.....  Are they getting cheap with the strength of the candles?
5,2019-06-01,One of my favorite candles.
5,2013-10-21,"I love my pumpkin pie candles in the fall.  Once I light it, you can smell the scent all through the house.  Its not too strong, just right.  Almost as if you were baking a pumpkin pie."
5,2020-01-08,"The candle comes in a great protective box, ready to wrap for a gift.  I absolutely love the smell and couldn't find it any longer in the stores.  I was delighted to find it here.  I bought 2."
5,2022-05-05,Sweet scent but not overwhelming
5,2021-03-05,I love Yankee Candles and I LOVE the way my house smells with ‘Home Sweet Home’!
5,2019-03-16,Not scent. Not to strong. Burns evenly.
5,2020-03-13,Bought this and another one as a house warming gift. You can’t go wrong with Yankee candles!
5,2021-12-05,"This  product smells amazing, a very warm smell and it isn't very strong but the smell lingers"
5,2019-08-28,Candle fan
1,2017-03-17,Smells very strongly of buttercream frosting... Almost to the point where it's sickening.
5,2015-03-16,Yankee candles are my favorite candles.  there are so many fragrances to chose from.  this reminds me of coconut pie which is my favorite pie.
5,2019-06-10,Gave out for Mothers Day they were a great splash.
3,2019-10-25,The candle scent and quality is fine.  The issue is that it was loose in a box that was barely taped shut and as a result the glass was shattered on one side.The product needs better packaging.
4,2021-06-30,"If you don't like strong smells, then you'l like it, and it did help my bonus room not smell like animals.  The smell itself is good, but it's not very strong.  The Chocolate Layer Cake candle is WAY better!"
4,2022-06-23,It’s a good throw but I feel like out of all the other ingredients it advertises cinnamon…that is what you recieve.
5,2018-11-28,I absolutely love Yankee candle.  This scent is heavenly.
1,2019-06-25,I was not able to use the candle because the glass jar was broken. Had to throw  it away.
1,2021-09-17,"I’ve always been a Yankee candle fan, until recently. The quality isnt what it used to be. I received a candle today and was shocked when I took the top off of the candle. It had mold on the top. At first I thought it was just air bubbles, but after getting a magnifying glass out and looking at it, it is definitely mold. I called customer service and they said I may have to return it for my refund. Which means I have to take it across town to the UPS store to return it. I was sold faulty merchandise and it should not be my responsibility to take care of a bad product.Beside the mold issues, which is enough, it barely had a scent. It may smell stronger once it is burning, but there’s no way I’m burning this candle."
5,2019-05-07,It’s a candle. It smells great.
3,2016-04-15,Looks like a melted thin mint cookie and smells great - but Yankee candles have become so disappointing. There's almost no scent when burning.
5,2018-12-27,My house smells SO good when I burn this candle. Love the aroma.
5,2018-12-13,"Homemade baked cookies in the oven, mmmmm."
5,2017-12-21,Got as Christmas gift and daughter loves smell.
4,2020-09-25,The candle smells great but it arrived with the jar in pieces. Customer service was excellent about the whole thing. I think these need to be package more carefully. There shouldve been bubble wrap inside but there was just a cardboard holder that was also broken.
3,2018-10-16,"Smells like men’s cologne, I don’t like it at all. Since there is no free return I will be give it away."
5,2018-06-13,Smells so good!!! It really does. It filled my entire home
2,2022-03-05,"I buy yankee candles all the time, normally having no issues with them. They typically smell great and fill up the room with a nice fragrance. This last candle however had virtually no scent at all. Decided to check the reviews and seen that im not the only one having this problem. If yankee cant deliver a consistent product on amazon, i wont be purchasing from them anymore. Not worth the risk, I'll try my luck elsewhere."
3,2021-10-19,"This is the first Yankee Candle that I didn't care for . The scent was not as I expected at all. The scent was more like a rancid and old smell . Was not giftable at all , the top of the wax was bubbly and discolored."
5,2019-12-14,Love the scent
4,2020-12-12,"I got this to add some Christmas cheer to my apartment. I love that the candle can burn all day without issue. The scent isn't as strong as I had hoped, but luckily it is more powerful than the Christmas cookie candle I also ordered."
5,2019-01-12,I bought this for a friend because she can't find in store. She loves the smell.
1,2020-10-10,The candle arrived in perfect condition and on time. I burned it for several hours for a few days and the fragrance was simply awful.
4,2018-08-31,"Love, love, love the scent of this candle and look forward to many hours of burning it.  I was, however, disappointed that when it arrived, the glass was cracked just under the lid.  I didn't find any loose shards of glass in the packing material, so it makes me wonder if it wasn't shipped to me in this condition.  The damage won't impact how the wax burns, though, so I decided not to return it and will keep it."
5,2014-01-01,"Love the smell of  Yankee Pumpkin Pie Candle during the fall season. This purchase arrived in a timely manner, item was well packaged, and condition as listed. Good purchase."
2,2022-07-28,Poorly scented
3,2019-05-04,"Item came brokenGlass wAs broken, I also have a photo of the item."
5,2021-12-06,The best scent they have!
5,2013-03-13,"For Valentine's Day I decided to pick something from my son's Wish List that he didn't get for Christmas.  This candle is one of my favorites, too, and it made a great gift!"
1,2020-05-30,Smells like nothing. Sooo disappointed!
5,2019-01-10,This candle is great for cold wintery nights!
5,2021-02-11,I’m really pleased with the smell and how well protect it was when I received it. The scent is not to strong and very pleasant for relaxation.
2,2020-10-25,"This candle was either fake or old. I've had new Yankees in Spiced Pumpkin before, and the smell is amazing. This one? Nothing. I let it burn for an hour and could not smell it. I left the room for a while and came back - still nothing. There is no point to an $18 spiced pumpkin candle if it does not smell and smell strongly. Returned."
5,2020-02-16,Smells so great
5,2018-12-14,This is my favorite yankee candle. It smells comforting and burns slow enough to enjoy. The value is well worth it.
5,2019-02-01,Nice candle that smells great!
5,2018-06-18,Amazing scent. Smells just as amazing as the description.
4,2020-06-07,There was no damage to the 2 boxes this candle was in but was shattered and broken glass inside holder. Be careful ordering candles!Still smells great but watch your hands!
2,2022-05-10,"I got the vanilla cupcake and burned it two days and absolutely no scent, I love candles and buy them all the time, Yankee used to be the best but now they’re charging outrageous prices and making them without a smell, there’s quite a few times I bought from them and there wasn’t any scent or it was very light you couldn’t smell it, I definitely will never buy vanilla cupcake again from them."
5,2013-10-25,"Love these candles!!! Great for fall, also!!! This is my favorite Yankee Candle scent!!!Makes the whole house smell great. Recommend to everyone!!!"
5,2018-12-20,"Yankee candle rocks, as usual."
5,2019-06-08,"I use this product after I get home from work, to make the place smell nice. Burning a few hours a day, it's still going a month later."
4,2021-02-26,Candle snells nice and the glass holder looks good.  A bit pricey but great gift idea.  The best part is that the packaging is awesome.  The only reason why not 5 stars was because I would have preferred a stronger atoma.
5,2020-06-10,We love this one!!
1,2018-02-06,They smell pretty cheap - I’ve gotten much higher quality for the same price from other brands.
1,2020-06-10,"I usually enjoy the smell of Yankee Candles. However, this one has absolutely no smell. You cannot even smell it when you are right on the jar. I am deeply disappointed!"
4,2020-11-23,I always buy this size jar and with 2 wicks now.  Easier to trim the wicks than narrower jar.  These  last longer than cheaper brands.  This scent is not as strong so it has to burn longer.  Cedar and Red Apple Wreath are stronger.
2,2018-05-09,"I question whether or not this is authentic Yankee Candle brand or a cheap knock off labeled and being sold as Yankee Candle.  I keep the wicks trimmed on all my candles and even doing that, the scent throw with this one can only be described as very weak.  It was used in a 12 x 12 bedroom so it should have filled the room with vanilla scent and it just didn't deliver.  I bought this one because it was $9.00 cheaper here than company's website so I thought it would be a good deal.  The Walmart brand vanilla bean throws more scent than this candle did.  I love French Vanilla Yankee Candles but am on the fence whether or not this one is authentic so I won't be buying it here again.  Very disappointed in this purchase."
5,2018-10-20,Yankee Candles are the best!!
5,2019-02-03,Very giftable.
5,2011-05-04,"I bought this candle ""scent unsmelled"", and I'm so glad I did! I love this candle! Vanilla scent is subtle, enough to add just a little warmth to the lime scent. To put it simply, it smells like Summer. Think key lime pie, margaritas on a tropical beach. It's just a wonderful fragrance, perfect for this time of year."
5,2019-04-09,Recommend
5,2019-12-27,"The candles were great, they were a little melted but it wasn’t significant to where the candles wouldn’t stay lit."
5,2019-07-18,Great product
4,2020-12-25,It smells good the only thing is that during shipping or something the candle heated enough to reform in the jar. It was actually cold out the day it was delivered so idk. But I dug the wick out and lit it and it’s fine
2,2018-01-11,Not as strong as I would like!  Why doesn’t Yankee Candle make the Hazelnut Candle anymore?  That was the best!!  But this candle doesn’t come close.
4,2020-04-22,"Smell was good but not as strong as I expected. I live in small space so it actually worked out OK, just seemed more faint than usual Yankee candles. Overall, the longevity of these candles can’t be beat. I always like to have a candle burning, just aesthetically, so these are perfect."
5,2013-07-11,"Great smell, not too strong and doesn't overwhelm the room but very subtle and creeps up on you. Very good for the colder months and definitely a favorite during thanksgiving"
5,2016-01-02,"This is my favorite scent from YC but hard to find in stores.  On the lines of their vanilla cupcake scent, but not as sweet with a buttery undertone. Well packaged and fast shipping."
5,2021-12-20,Great present. Smells amazing
4,2018-06-12,"Smell isnt my favorite yankee, pretty strong though !"
1,2019-01-18,I paid 18 dollars for a dim light.... Candle barely has a fragrance. Very dissapointing. I was not looking for an overwhelming smell but this is the polar opposite. I have to get within inches to smell it.
5,2018-03-27,My favorite scent...I want to buy out the store!
4,2020-11-10,"Great scent and has lasted a few weeks of regular use so far, lost 1 star bc it’s tunneled as the flame isn’t strong enough to heat the wax along the sides of the jar. Walls of the tunnel are ab 1/2 inch thick so pretty substantial wax being missed."
5,2018-02-06,"This candle is lovely,it smells so good but not stong."
5,2016-12-16,I love those girl scout mint cookies and this Yankee candle reminds me of these wonderful cookies.
5,2018-10-06,doesn't burn too fast
4,2021-10-21,"Too expensive for the product. See photo to see how it arrived.  An expensive candle, thrown upside down during delivery on a hot day."
4,2016-11-15,Smells Great. I use this candle almost every day and in 15 minutes the room smells incredible.
5,2019-06-12,Nice calming scent
5,2019-02-19,Great scent
4,2020-08-09,Love cozy and homey scent. Wish they lasted longer though.
5,2017-04-22,Nice Candel.  Seasonal at the stores and you can get it year round on Amazon. Woo hoo
5,2018-11-17,Smells so good
5,2019-10-07,Great scent!
4,2022-02-28,"This smells like cake mix, which has that weird artificial vanilla odor. You have to like that smell."
3,2020-12-19,"I have noticed something with these Yankee Candles after buying them for years. The newer ones with the narrow label shown in  this ad, have almost no scent. If you can find one with the older wide label you will have alot of scent.I buy them from all over...here on Amz, Ebay, etc and if you have a choice get one shown with the older wide label. There seems to be a big difference in the amount of scent. My bad for buying this one :("
5,2019-06-30,Just all around amazing candle.  Lovely warm scent.
5,2018-11-08,Love this thank you
2,2019-12-25,The smell was not strong at all. It was not even subtle
1,2018-08-24,"Zero scent, the reviews led me astray."
4,2021-02-16,"I enjoyed the scent, I did not find it overwhelming.  Its lasted for more than a month, burning a couple times a week.  I gave one to a friend at Christmas and she enjoys the candle as well."
5,2018-11-15,Smells wonderful!
5,2020-10-26,Best sent for the Autumn Season!
5,2017-05-01,What a great fragrance smell liking both coconut and vanilla what can go wrong!😀
5,2020-06-16,Always delivered quickly and damage free
5,2018-04-04,My favorite fragrance.  So happy they brought it back.
2,2020-01-14,So disappointed! Home Sweet Home is my all time favorite Yankee Candle scent and this one must have been a quality control reject. First the wick was so short I could barely get it to light. Yankee candle lovers know you always need to trim the wick. Second there is barely a scent! I even tried leaving the candle lit in my bedroom with the door closed for 3 hours. I expected to be hit with the scent when I entered the room but it didn’t happen. Will stick with shopping directly with Yankee Candle shops.
5,2012-08-20,I bought this candle for my son because it's his favorite Yankee candle scent.  He loves that it has two wicks because it eluminates his room quite nicely.
5,2020-02-19,Love the subtle yet widespread sweet smell
5,2015-01-16,"I burn candles a lot. A big part of my environment is smell. This candle is one of my favorites. Yankee candle, you've done it again!"
4,2020-01-04,"I was a little disappointed because the smell didn’t fill the room the way I’m use to from Yankee candles, however I am in a new home with vaulted ceilings and that could also be a factor. I can say that the smell is delicious and it has lasted a reasonable amount of time- as expected."
3,2015-09-02,"The only way to get a good whiff of this candle, even after it burns for hours, is to get right up to it."
5,2012-11-27,"The sparkling cinnamon candle is exactly as described. The shipping was fast and arrived in excellent condition on time.The scent is a lovely scent, great for the Christmas Holiday.  This is a large candle. This will last me a long time.I will definatly buy more again."
5,2016-06-20,"Bought this candle for my Mom and she loves the smell. Don't let you Mom down, buy her this candle."
5,2019-12-17,Love this candle and it smells great!
5,2014-01-02,I love lime. This was light and mellow and smelled like Key Lime Pie. Yummy! This was on clearance when I bought it so the price was great too.
5,2018-07-06,Very pleased with purchase!
1,2020-02-25,"Don't be a sucker like i was. Even after all the warnings, all the people who were like, THERE IS NO SMELL, i was like, but the RATINGS. they are so HIGH.Don't be fooled. I have been burning this dumb candle for a whole day and it smells like MAYBE a cinnamon stick two rooms away sneezed into a tissue. And that is only if you have your face over the burning flame. And even then I wasn't even sure.The only time i smelled anything was when i first opened the candle, and it seemed to evaporate. Even after i closed it and tried to let the smell build up again nothing happened.DO NOT BUY IT. Save your money. Get two cinnamon sticks and rub them together. It would be a better use of time and money."
5,2018-11-05,Smells amazing
3,2018-11-09,The scent  was very weak
5,2018-05-30,Great candle for a great price
4,2019-12-29,"I’ve been ordering many yankee candles lately and I’ve been disappointed in the strength of the scent of most of them. But this one is delicious! By far my favorite. It really does smell like real caramel and makes my whole living room smell delicious. Also, great price!!!!"
5,2018-10-20,Good Scent
2,2020-09-16,"I have older ""spiced pumpkin"" candles -- it has a strong, pleasant scent. These older candles can be identified by the label: If it says ""a subsidiary of Jarden Corporation"", BUY IT!  If it says, ""a subsidiary of Newell Brands"", BUY SOMETHNG ELSE! These new ones are ""meh"". I'm not impressed."
5,2018-12-01,My new fave scent
5,2018-12-25,Awesome gift
3,2016-12-20,"Came without a label. Not sure what that's about. Smells ok, not as strong as I would have liked it to be."
5,2013-06-20,"Yankee Candle's are pretty much fullproof in their ability to smell up an entire floor of a house, and this flavor is a perfect one for mixing in."
3,2022-01-13,"I love Yankee candles, but just like everything there’s going to be some since you like less than others, home for the holidays is it my top choice. I was able to give this as a gift though and the person receiving it absolutely loved it. It all worked out and again it was packaged impeccably."
5,2019-12-10,Love this scent!  I'm so disappointed that Yankee Candle discontinued it and I was thrilled to find it here.  I got one for myself and gifted a few others.  Everyone loves it!
5,2020-01-16,Don't tell me what to do Amazon be thankful I reviewed something
5,2017-07-17,"This scent is remarkably similar to Macintosh Apple, so I love it."
5,2018-05-22,I love this scent for fall.
4,2021-04-19,"Burn really nice slow ,must keep wicks trim so theres no smoke not 5 star on scent seems less than what yankee is knowen for is giftable thou buy on sale too!! Dee in michigan 2021"
5,2018-04-16,This may be my favorite yankee scent now!
5,2018-04-18,Long lasting with a good throw. Great value.
5,2018-12-26,A+
5,2018-09-07,Amazing smell !!!
3,2013-10-10,"This is the first time I've purchased a Yankee Candle. I usually just buy Glade candles (those are very strong). Since I was having a pumpkin carving party, I decided to get this pumpkin pie scented candle. You can kind of smell it but it's not very strong.I don't think it was worth the price. I know there is a Yankee outlet and will only get my candles there if I buy this brand again."
4,2021-10-29,Love Yankee candles! But I was surprised that this one wasn't nearly as fragrant as some of the others I've purchased.
5,2017-12-26,"I always love Yankee Candles, they are the best"
5,2021-03-22,Exactly what I expected.
5,2014-03-24,I absolutely love pumpkin candles. This is the dreamiest pumpkin candle I have ever smelled. Perfect for the fall season.
5,2021-07-03,"Smells divine! Highly recommended! Vanilla, vanilla mmnnnn :)"
5,2018-04-27,Great product fast delivery
3,2020-11-23,"I've placed 4 separate orders on Amazon for 2 candles per order (over the last 2 weeks).  On 2 orders, I have gotten the wrong candles.  Who is doing QC on these orders?  The candles are nice, and they smell good, but when your order 2 of the same candle and get random candles in the box...that's a problem.The candle smells good, but 3 stars because the seller needs to do better."
3,2014-06-06,The  candle is ok but lacks the strong scent that you come to expect from Yankee candles. Just not a very strong smelling candle.
5,2018-03-16,Smells amazing! Good sized candle.
4,2017-12-15,"Smells decent, Yankee has better ones though."
5,2018-05-31,Arrived fast.  Love this scent.
5,2017-09-19,Smells great.
5,2016-02-05,This candle has an amazing scent.  It was packaged well and arrived in a timely manner.  Will buy again.
5,2018-05-19,My mom loves these candles...
5,2018-11-03,Makes my house smell like I just baked a cake....
5,2018-01-25,The best Candle ever. Love this scent!
5,2018-01-27,"Smells great, and has a strong scent."
3,2020-04-15,"I was so eager to get this as I'd read several reviews-not all on Amazon- describing it as heavenly. Throw was listed as 5, meaning the fragrance would easily fill a large area.The scent is excellent but not strong at all. I wanted a candle that would scent the large open area of our home. This does not.If you like a warm fragrance reminiscent of baking you will love this as long as you dont expect it to be a strong scent."
5,2018-08-04,😄😄😄😄😄😄
1,2021-09-22,"I purchased this for My Mom's funeral. French Vanilla is her favorite. I didnt open the box til the day of. The candle was for the communion table in the sanctuary. Lit before the service started, couldnt smell even a hint of Vanilla. I dont understand how a company could push their obviously old merchandise. Always bought yankee brand. And trusted that there wouldn't be a problem. Wish I read THE REVIEWS. I see the media is blaming it on covid. LOL 😆"
5,2020-09-12,It’s smell mellow but this lingers on after it is snuffed. It’s smells so pretty and warm. But these are my kinds of scents... a very u issue one here.
5,2018-07-27,Got as a gift
5,2016-05-28,Great packaging. Third transaction. Very expensive but I need it around ST Patrick's day.
5,2020-10-31,I love this candle. I’m told it’s discontinued but I can count on Amazon to have it!
5,2017-11-24,As described. Came in great condition.
5,2019-07-02,Good size
2,2020-11-03,"I have been buying Yankee candles for years and have always liked them.  I almost always buy Cinnamon stick and when the large jar is done I order another.The candle I bought earlier this year has barely any scent, where it used to fill the entire level of the house with fragrance.I wasted $30 on this thing and wish I could return it.I will not be buying from Yankee anymore in the future."
2,2020-04-28,I've bought other pumpkin spice candles with a better scent then this.
5,2018-02-19,Lasted forever. Excellent pumpkin scent.
5,2017-02-24,My favorite candle and my favorite scent!!
5,2017-06-08,Great scent and lasts a long time. Really enjoy it.
5,2014-11-17,The downside to having this is that I went on a diet two weeks ago and now all I want is chocolate cake.
5,2020-01-08,I love this candle it is my favorite candle of all time!!!
5,2019-12-11,I love the smell of this candle. I have one for myself. This one is a gift.
5,2018-11-29,Candle was great!
5,2021-11-11,Smells great and lasts a long time
5,2019-12-26,Yankee Candles are always amazing.  The scent does not overwhelm just perfect.  Burns clean
5,2014-06-03,Vanilla lime is a good candle for the kitchen.  The smell is subtle and not overpowering.  Burns evenly and lasts long.
4,2018-06-16,love candles
5,2014-10-25,Wonderfully aromatic candle that smells of everything fall! Seasons Blessings compliments Harvest Welcome perfectly!
5,2018-02-06,On time and as described
4,2019-02-21,Not sure if this smells like a spiced pumpkin as I have never spiced one but it is a very pleasant and nose pleasing scent.  Unfortunately it tunnels like my last two Yankee candle in spite of my trimming the wick and allowing the candle to burn for at least 4 hours.  Next to Autumn Wreath this is our favorite scent.
5,2018-11-27,Was looking everywhere for this fragrance! The price was great!
4,2016-04-14,"Unfortunately, this candle arrived broken so I can't say much but it does smell good."
5,2018-05-07,Delicious Smell!
3,2021-10-30,"Smell is good, but it is the name you're paying for. Plenty of less expensive candles that last as long and smell as strong and good for about half the price. Burnt the candle about 1/3 of the way and the way it was made,, the wick was too close to the glass and it cracked from the heat."
3,2017-12-10,"I chose Yankee candle for its reputation for their nice strong scent. This candle has only a faint smell to it.  Not sure if it was just a bad batch, design/recipe change, impact of environmental conditions and/or age, but I’m overall disappointed.To their credit, they are made in the USA.  They have a rated burn time of 110-150 hrs., which seems about right based on my experience so far.I’ll be either trying something else or purchasing from a store next time due to the weak scent, since that is the most important attribute for me."
3,2019-12-12,"I was very disappointed by Yankee Candle.  Normally their candles are my favorite and this one smells like burned cookies.  This is not a good scent and it doesn't smell chocolatey or like a chocolate layer cake at all.  It is no longer available in stores and I understand that Yankee Candle discontinued this scent.  I purchased as a gift and also bought one for myself.  Once I lit the candle, and smelled how horrible it is, I returned the one I purchased as a gift."
2,2020-11-15,This candle has absolutely no smell… I am wondering if it is a knock off.
1,2020-07-30,"This candle had little to no scent, which was the main reason I bought it."
5,2017-01-04,Always the best! Love pumpkin scent!!
4,2017-10-03,Put you in the mood for autumn!
5,2016-11-17,"My Yankee ""Pumpkin Buttercream ""candle was perfect in every way. This candle is richly scented, without being too spicy or overwhelming. Guests always tell me they love the aroma in my home! I am very pleased."
5,2018-04-10,My newest favorite
5,2020-07-11,Great!
5,2014-01-26,"Smells awesome!  Burns kind of quickly though.ThThe first time I lit it, half of it melted within a couple of hours"
5,2016-07-25,Got this as a gift and she loved it!! The fragrance is really very nice.
5,2017-03-01,Very nice
4,2022-05-14,"My recent yankee candle purchases, French Vanilla and Lemon Lavender were disappointments. The candles produced black soot on my ceilings. The scent Yankee Candles always provide, was lacking. Amazon please stop buying from your new supplier. I want my Old Yankee Candles BACK!!!!! The Cupcake Vanilla was Great!"
3,2020-10-21,"My household loves Yankee Candles. We purchased the Spiced Pumpkin scent for the fall. I've tried the votive size before and they spelled great. However, this larger jar doesn't seem to smell much. When we burn the candle, we can barely smell it. Disappointing because it's such a large jar. The candle was packaged very well so there was no issues with breaking."
5,2018-02-09,Gave as gift
5,2016-12-28,Smells delicious and fits nicely into a candle warmer.
5,2018-04-04,Smells good
5,2020-06-29,I love this candle! It smells great and last a long time!
5,2018-06-06,Use it
5,2018-11-14,definitely worth it
4,2022-03-03,"Compared to all other brands of candles I’ve purchased in the past year or so, this one definitely burns longer than all of them. The scent is not potent but more subtle, which I don’t mind at all. Good vanilla candle, not too sweet."
1,2017-01-31,"Very expensive candle with very poor quality! When it arrived a reddish Caramel Apple Cake scented ""type of oil"" covered the inside and outside of the jar along with the bubble wrap. It appeared like some of the scent leaked out of the wax. This was a Christmas present from a Son to his Mother. Very disappointed!!!"
5,2018-02-14,Love this scent
5,2018-02-17,My favorite scent!
2,2012-11-20,Love yankee candles but this scent is not strong at all.  Not worth the money I paid and will not buy this scent again.
5,2014-12-20,Love Yankee Candles and the Chocolate Layer Cake. Smells like moms baking.
3,2021-08-26,I like Yankee Candles & I bought this on Prime Day for $13.99 for the large size. I love vanilla scent but Yankee Candle could certainly have made the scent much stronger. If I burn it for 4 hours I will smell a faint scent. Anything less than 4 hours you don’t get a noticeable scent.
5,2013-01-15,"she smells very sour and sweet. simple. savoring and flavorful, ghetto booty for two reasons and that's the LADYS N THE DRINKS"
4,2022-05-04,This brand is good. Nice smell. Good to buy folks.
5,2021-11-10,I love it! Great scent!
3,2015-02-07,"Nice candle, however, would LOVE TO find a candle that actually has a scent to it."
5,2017-10-09,My favorite Fall candle.
5,2017-04-09,Good price
5,2017-01-05,It's a nice smelling candle that warms me up inside. It arrived on time. What else can I say...
5,2013-09-13,Love this smell ! Some places on amazon actually sell old candles and tarts that have no smell left once you get them :'( This one was is perfect. Will be buying another soon.
2,2021-07-13,"I purchased this and had to return it the moment I was in-store at Walmart and saw the same scent via Better Homes & Gardens (French Country Vanilla) that was 2 ounces less but worth $10.36 less than Yankee Candles!!It's literally like you're just paying for the brand! As someone who has to watch every penny, it's not reasonable to purchase a candle that I could get for $5.97 with the same scent and durability.Make smarter purchases guys. This is not it!"
5,2012-12-27,If you like expensive candles then look no further then this Yankee Candle right here. It has all your candle needs.
1,2022-05-16,"If it’s your first time trying yankee candle be cautious and be prepared to possibly return them. I was SUPER Excited to get these candles. When you think of Yankee candle you think of the best… Or So I thought. I purchased these because I saw that there on sale for $16.99 but now I’m questioning maybe this is the reason that they were marked down to $16.99. However I don’t even think that it’s worth that much, this candle literally has no scent unless I stick my nose to the wax…super disappointed…I would never pay this much money for a non-scented candle. So I’m kind of upset because this was my first experience with Yankee and now I’m scared to order any other Yankee candles from Amazon. I’ve had the candles for about 3-4 days now and I am now in the process of returning them for full refund. From now on I’m ordering my candles from Walmart Or Bath & body Works. I can spend less or the same amount and get a terrific smelling candle that will make my entire room or home smell."
5,2010-04-25,Yum. I love Yankee candles and how they last. Spiced pumpkin has to be one of the best scents out there. Highly recommmened.
5,2019-03-09,Loved the smell and it burned clean and evenly. Will buy again.
5,2018-04-09,Just what I expected !
5,2017-03-28,It's a candle. It smells nice. Long lasting.
3,2021-01-08,"As my title suggests, the scent doesn't travel far on this candle but it still smells good. I bought this candle because I have the car jar in the apple pumpkin and that is amazing. This didn't quite live up to how much I love the car jar. The candle somehow smells a little different, not as good, as the car jar in my opinion. But like I said, it's still a nice smell."
4,2017-07-26,Yankee is well known and lovely
5,2015-10-20,I love using Yankee Candles for the different seasons. This one screams Fall :)
5,2018-02-17,Nice
5,2018-02-06,Love them!
5,2013-11-20,Great scent that is not flowery or overbearing. This is a great neutral candle (I'm a guy and I love it).
5,2018-01-24,Good price.
3,2021-02-03,"Yankee candles must be going downhill. It does smell nice, but as you can see it burns terrible. Half of the candle will be wasted. So basically what you get is half the size for more money. I will probably be switching brands."
5,2017-06-06,This was a gift and she loved it!
4,2022-05-30,Very nice sent. Way too expencive
1,2020-03-11,Item arrived with a giant liquid stain of some sort on the side of the tumbler. The stain is inside the glass.
5,2018-01-12,Very pleased.
1,2021-11-03,"I don't know if I got a defective one or not, but it doesn't smell at all. I gave it two stars instead of one, though, because it does have excellent longevity. I'll probably put it in our emergency kit stash, as it's going to last a long time."
5,2016-01-22,This product is just what everyone needs on their home it's warm and comforting. I'm a huge fan of Yankee candles and Amszon for the savings!!!
5,2017-05-15,This hard to find scent is lovely
2,2022-03-13,PROB OLD.. NO SCENT AT ALL
4,2019-06-30,Uh
4,2015-02-18,"I like the smell of this candle, but it doesn't seem to be as strong as the apple pumpkin one that I have. This vanilla cupcake candle doesn't seem to fill the room up with pleasurable odor and linger even after the candle is out quite as much as I was hoping.Don't get me wrong. It still performs better than the cheap candles I've bought in the past, but it doesn't blow me away. And when I pay nearly 30 bucks for a candle, I'd like to be blown away.If you're looking for a strong candle with a powerful odor, then I had success with the apple pumpkin by Yankee Candle. If you're looking for a change of pace, the vanilla cupcake is good but not great."
3,2019-10-05,"I love the fall scent, but had to cut up the candle to use as wax melts instead of a traditional candle. The top half of the glass was shattered during shipping, which made it difficult to use for it's original purpose.Note: I ordered 2 additional candles in another scent that arrived in the same box, both of which were completely intact. So don't be afraid to order one, just know there is a possibility it may get damaged on the way."
5,2016-06-13,Smells just like the thin mints cookies. Nice candle.
5,2018-09-04,A+
4,2021-02-17,So.. I ordered the large jar french vanilla and got pink sands instead. I cant really complain because I was planning to try pink sands out after french vanilla and it was like $11 off. Pink sands is a pretty good smelling candle to the point I would probably want to smell like this candle everyday. It also would be good as a bathroom candle when you're taking a bath or wanna get rid of a bad smell. Would've been 5 stars if I actually ordered pink sands.
4,2020-04-16,scent seems off for a Yankee candle?? Also burn time seems faster? compared this candle with one from the brick and mortar storethis candle burned out three days before the brick and mortar version....?
1,2017-10-23,"SO INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED!  NOT EVEN A HINT OF SCENT! This is my all-time favorite candle, and so I made my annual purchase of two candles.  But the candles did not have any scent.  I kept burning them, hoping it was buried somewhere down below, but I'm half way through and still nothing for BOTH of them!  I'm guessing they are VERY OLD candles, because I've used some Yankee Candles for years and have always had strong scents.  Buyer Beware!"
3,2021-09-25,Smells like it should…the whole box smelled like the candle should but that’s because the candle leaked out into the box. It also looks yellow and looks white in the product pictures…not sure what that’s about. Oh well it at least smells like it should
4,2021-03-18,So far so good thanks.
2,2022-06-17,"For some reason, when I buy Yankee brand from Amazon, these candles always burn weird & I have to prop them to one side or another & push the wax down often. I used to sell candles as a 2nd income & know what I'm doing! Tried several thru Amazon but will now buy direct from Yankee"
5,2017-10-24,smells great
4,2019-12-20,So I live in a basement apartment and honestly this really does scent up my place at least in half of the apartment. It does burn well and I noticed it lasts long.The smell isn't overbearing and I mean who doesn't love a good pumpkin spice !!
4,2019-02-11,"The candle is terrific, but I found the smell lighter than I had remembered it. However, the burn time on these candles makes up for the lack of fragrance.  When I saw these on Amazon, as well as the number of choices I have with the scents offered I knew it was a good value."
2,2022-03-22,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 Every time I have ordered a yankee candle they come broken.  I cannot send them back because the broken glass is a danger in the mail, so no refund even though I sent a photo.This also happened to my son when he bought a personalized candle with his nieces and nephews photo on it for his sister for Christmas."
5,2017-11-25,Love it
5,2018-07-17,Smell
3,2022-01-05,"My daughter loves candles. I bought this as a gift but didnt realize it has more of a cinnamon smell. She just bought her first house so I liked the name ""home sweet home"". She loved it and thats all that matters. LOL"
4,2013-05-26,This candle was as I anticipated it to be wonderful. A beautiful scent and great addition to a cold winter.
5,2018-04-05,Great
3,2020-11-16,"The Sparkling Cinnamon: Smells amazing, but a piece broke of easily as I was putting the lid on. Disappointed though because I could not give it as a gift - which is the reason I got it.The Balsam Cedar: I LOVE the smell so much! but I was sad when I opened it. It was all broken in pieces :( so I couldn’t give it as a gift either."
1,2022-05-20,"Vanilla CupcakeI've been a Yankee Candle fan for MANY years, and I know how to burn candles, keep wicks trimmed correctly and get a full melt pool before putting it out. Not with this one, it burns terrible and has a huge tunnel right down the middle of the jar so half of the candle will be wasted. So basically, what you get is half the size for more money. I do love the scent of Vanilla Cupcake, but once lit it has very little throw. I also purchased Kitchen Spice, burns the way it should but no scent, lit or unlit. Pink Sands burns great and smells great, but I got it for the bedroom I don't want it for my kitchen. Complete waste of money on 2 out of 3 candles. I will probably be switching brands as I cannot afford to waste money on something that I can't use. Very Sad...."
3,2022-03-30,"Nice scent. Sadly, not very strong!Update 6/9/2022Second time I lit the candle I could hardly smell the scent. Went as far as bending over the jar. Very disappointed! Must of gotten a lemon."
5,2014-09-24,The candle is actually good but the company called GrandmasGiftware does not guarentee nothing!!!  BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!
5,2019-12-16,As described.  Smells great.
4,2022-01-16,Great scent but burns unevenly as it only has one wick.
5,2018-10-17,My home
5,2013-03-04,Nithing reminds me of fall more than this timeless scent.  I ordered a variety of sizes to make sure the scent could be carried to every room in the house
1,2018-07-09,"This candle smells like a scratch-n-sniff version of chocolate, not at all robust and delicious, just smells cheap.  Even my kiddos think it stinks."
5,2019-06-13,I light this candle along with spiced pumpkin and my house smells wonderful!  Get many compliments ad ask what candles are they.  Love them!!!
4,2020-12-20,"Crisp Fall Night Scent:The scent is rather mild, but very pleasant. Its beautiful as decoratiom as well, very cozy feeling. The acenr is definetly not as strong as some other Yankee Candles, but works well on small areas."
5,2015-05-19,This was another gift for my daughter & son-in-law and both loved the smell.
5,2017-06-10,Smells yummy!!
3,2019-12-15,Didn't have a strong smell
5,2014-11-16,I love Yankee candles and this one was a great price. Smells great of course!
5,2017-01-31,Dependable Brand.  Great Scent.
4,2021-03-23,"This is a great, warm scent. Good notes of cinnamon, but not too strong. Candle has to burn a while before I can smell it."
3,2018-02-21,"Was going to give this as part of a gift to my friends house warming basket, but it arrived all dirty and it won’t come off the glass no matter how hard I clean it. Also, the candle isn’t secure in the holder, it shakes around like it’s way smaller than the glass. Anyway, I’ll keep it for around my house but can’t give this to my friend. It just looks used and abused."
5,2016-12-22,"very nice quality, would buy again"
1,2016-11-11,Disappointed! I don't believe it's a real Yankee Candle. Isn't the same as the ones I've always had. The aroma is not as strong. I'm wondering if it's a knock-off brand.
5,2014-11-23,Very strong throw.  Smells like smoked ham.
3,2020-08-06,"Candle came melted due to improper storage, I had to completely melt it with boiling water to make it usable."
5,2016-12-27,My favorite fall and winter scent!
5,2018-11-28,Fragrance is very mild. Not sure i smell it at all
5,2017-04-18,Smells wonderful!
4,2019-12-02,"The scent is great but a little melted wax around the lid rim, probably won't order again if I can find it elsewhere.  Jar is not as heavy as the ""Home Inspirations"" New Yankee candles sold in other non-New Yankee stores."
1,2019-11-20,"DO NOT BUY!! Set your money on fire. It will smell better and smoke less. I find it hard to believe, that this is even a real Yankee Candle. If it is, I will never buy one again. It smells good when you open the box. The moment you snip the wick and light the candle, the disappointment begins. Smells like a rip off and smokes like chimney. The seller should be ashamed of themselves."
5,2017-06-19,Smells delicious!
5,2016-11-13,"Smells superb, use it everyday, not overpowering"
5,2017-07-23,Excellent!
5,2019-12-14,Smells so amazing and really fills up a room nicely without being overwhelming.
3,2015-05-25,Long lasting. Smells good. But does not smell like a thin mint while burning.
1,2019-12-12,Not worth the buy online. Everything will be broken upron arrival anyways
1,2016-11-07,Poor scent :-(
5,2020-01-18,Nice size candle smells great
4,2021-12-21,Nice long lasting with wonderful scent. A very good price.
5,2013-02-13,I love this candle! I buy one or two a year. The smell is amazing and is fitting year round.
5,2019-12-05,Fantastic candle. Love the scent.
5,2018-10-10,This is one of my favorite Yankee Candle scents. Combination of Apple and Pumpkin. Just right for Autumn.
4,2016-04-22,"I love the smell, however one of the candle glass jar was broken, it cut my finger while I tried to unwrap it."
5,2021-02-09,"Got this for a friend who really likes candles, and she loved the scent!!"
5,2015-11-07,What can you say about Yankee Candles?  They are perfect!
4,2020-12-05,We like Yankee Candle but  this scent had no real throw. Lately my Yankee candles don’t burn away to nothing as they used to. We haven’t changed the way we burn candles and we read the instructions...it just seems there is a lot of wax left at the end and the wicks won’t stay lit
5,2018-09-12,This is my all time favorite candle
4,2019-12-06,It came safely wrapped which was a good surprise...very nice cinnamon scent... not overwhelmingHas a nice flame length and looks pretty reflecting from my fireplace glass front.Good price
4,2021-06-01,I am a regular shopper for Yankee and this fragrance is a favorite if you like sweetness of cookies baking.
5,2019-12-16,This candle is making me hungry! Waxy taste but great smell :)
5,2015-10-05,Smells amazing. Highly recommend it. Fast shipping.
5,2016-01-19,Smell awesome and burns for a very long time.
4,2022-02-10,Good as expected thank you!
1,2022-04-05,"This candle did not smell really, except for the smell of hot wax. The barest hint of cinnamon could be detected, but only if I put my face right over it. In addition, you can see in the photos that the wax frosted after use. It is my understanding that only soy wax did this, not paraffin wax (which is what this page says it was made with.) At this point, I feel like I was duped, my money was stolen, and I have a mostly scentless lump of wax in my garbage can."
5,2018-03-27,Love this scent. Lasts forever
1,2017-11-18,"My candle came all greasy seems like it was in a hot place for a while, and it melted and leaked out of the top. I love yankee candles and ive gotten this sent before so other than the leaking that i cleaned it was fine!"
5,2018-04-16,Best candle ever.  Smells awesome. Have one going all the time.
5,2018-07-31,Smells great
5,2017-01-04,This is fantastic
1,2022-01-17,"YANKEE CANDLE WHAT HAPPENED?? Don't waste your money.2021 Christmas present. My husband bought 2 Spiced Pumpkin, 2 Vanilla Cupcake & 1 Home Sweet Home (wood wick).Spiced Pumpkin & Vanilla Cupcake are literally a non-scented candles sold as scented.  I haven't tried the Home Sweet Home. Hoping that one will be better.The 3rd  candle in my pictures is a small company who makes soy candles. This candle sold for $12.50 at my small country store that I owned a few years back. It's a much better quality candle with a fantastic scent throw. The scent is throughout my house, even floats up to my upstairs hallway (1,900 sq ft house). Yet, 2 Yankee candles, burning at the same time can't even throw a scent in the room they're lit in.I think I'll save them & use them at night on the deck. Usually, I use dollar store candles for that, but these aren't any different from dollar store candles. Done with Yankee Candle Co."
5,2015-08-04,Great candle. Was waiting for them to do a bourbon cented candle. It is a great scent and smeeks good throughout the house.
2,2022-01-22,"I decided to try the Yankee brand because I have heard that they are really good quality. The scent can hardly be smelt.  It isn’t a bad smell, it just is super weak.  I ended up getting another candle from Walmart that is just their Better Homes and Garden brand and it smells so much better."
5,2018-04-08,Love the smell.
5,2017-05-24,MY FAV
5,2015-04-03,My favorite pumpkin candle from Yankee.
5,2020-06-29,"Arrived quickly, smells great"
4,2019-02-05,"This smells great when it's lit - throws scent around the whole apt. It does have kind of a weird after smell, which I've noticed with all salted caramel candles... they smell almost like turmeric or something? I can't make out what it is, but it's not salted caramel!"
3,2016-09-16,Broken when arrived. Had to return
5,2019-06-25,Smells amazing
5,2017-04-06,great smell
5,2016-02-11,Wonderful slightly spicy pumpkin scent.
5,2015-10-20,This is a strongly aromatic candle. I love it!
2,2021-01-01,"I bought this hoping it would provide a calming scent to enjoy being stuck at home during the pandemic. Instead, the scent was cloying, fake, and too strong. I tried it a couple of times and ended up donating it to Goodwill. Disappointed.I would recommend the Hearth and Hand with Magnolia candle in Sugared Birch instead -- smells like a Christmas tree and is very pleasant without being overpowering."
4,2014-12-17,"Great, now my living room smells like pumpkin.  Great smell."
5,2014-11-12,Love the smell I love anything that smells vanilla
5,2013-06-11,"The candle arrived quickly, we'll protected with bubble wrap.  It smells delightful.  I am very pleased.  I just wish it was available in tea lights."
5,2018-09-11,"Lasts a long time, smells great"
5,2016-12-28,nice smell
4,2019-02-01,"Very good scent for the Holidays. Burns evenly which is nice. I have had so many other candles when they burn, the wax melts and burns out the flame!! I have never had that problem with Yankee candles."
2,2021-11-03,"I have been a loyal customer of Yankee Candle for years. I love their products; the scents are always perfectly concentrated for me to enjoy the holiday season especially. I appreciate their willingness to replace my deliveries twice.However, I will NO LONGER buy their candles online. As wondrous as their products are, their package team leaves much to be desired. Every order and complimentary replacement arrived broken. Package glass better, please! Thank you for the replacements, but get it together."
5,2016-08-09,this candle smells amazing
3,2018-12-04,"Use in a large room like the kitchen. Not in a small bedroom, they are very potentBut wonderful smelling."
5,2018-05-01,Favorite scent!
3,2020-12-23,"The candle is nice, burns a long time.  Decal is easy to remove, but the scent?!?  Faint and not really vanilla...more like old play dough.  Plenty of good reviews, maybe I just got a bad batch."
5,2019-07-18,😀😍
1,2022-01-13,"Very disappointed in the Yankee Candle. There is nothing more frustrating than spending a good chunk of money on a candle that can't send out a fragrance (not even in the room that it's  placed in).The scent throw is very poor. The cold scent is also weak.My husband bought 5 Yankee Candles from Amazon.  Two Vanilla Cupcake, which is the worst of them. Two Spiced Pumpkin, which has a strong cold scent, but again little scent throw when lit.And the 5th candle, called Home Sweet Home, we haven't yet burned. Hopefully, results will be better.I guess Yankee Candle Co. has switched production materials since I last had their candle (it's been a long time).  I've been buying other candle brands & I love using wax melts. Even Thompson wax melts, that I buy from Tractor Supply (and are carried at independent country stores) are WAY better then this Vanilla Cupcake candle from Yankee."
4,2015-11-08,"Great scent! Never get tired of it all through the fall. Attractive warm color. Does not smell like corn. Keep this one around for autumn to give a cozy atmosphere. Only complaint is that mine arrived somewhat melted and seeped onto the packaging. Was going to give as gift, but decided to keep it for myself. I'll bought the one to give as a gift at the shop in the mall and paid a few more bucks for a nicer presentation."
5,2014-08-07,Oh it smells like bacon! Very potent!  Loved it
5,2017-02-14,A-OK
5,2020-02-07,Nice smell
4,2016-10-21,Great scent
5,2017-03-20,Product arrived promptly and as described.
5,2018-04-04,very nice. Thank you.
5,2015-03-16,Wish you had more. I love the smell! So chocolaty!
1,2015-09-09,Came melted in the jar and had leaked out.
5,2018-06-26,Yankee candles are one of the better candles you can buy. I have been buying Yankee for years. Can't go wrong when you buy them.
5,2016-08-30,Love yankee candles
5,2015-10-08,Wonderful scent! I will buy again.
5,2017-01-02,Smells awesome
3,2019-11-11,"I’m a little disappointed. Although this does smell like vanilla it’s not buttercream. I have bought a lot of buttercream yankee candles in the past and this is not it.(Update) apparently Yankee candle has changed their recipe for this candle so unless you can find an older version you won’t get that original buttercream scent. Bring back the original scent Yankee, please."
5,2019-04-17,Can smell it in the entire upstairs
4,2021-01-11,"Smells wonderful,but half the candle is lost,because it doesn’t burn evenly~For the price,it should"
4,2021-01-28,"Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Home Sweet Home, smells like cinnamon. Incase anyone is wondering."
5,2018-02-20,A+
5,2019-01-20,Smells awesome and last long
2,2018-12-24,This is the first  time I have been disappointed in a Yankee candle. Very little scent to it and the wick burns fast and black.
3,2022-01-10,"Yankee candles are not consistent with their fragrance. I don't understand why u could depend on their great small and now u can’t.After burns down some, I can't smell anything"
4,2015-03-08,"Is this my most favorite candle ever, no. But this candle is the perfect, in between season's candle! I like a beachy and fruity candles in the summer, I love mulled cider type of candles in the fall and I love Christmas candles. But this candle has been perfect for January thru May and it'll last a good long time too! If you are looking for a great mild scent that doesn't take over the house, then this candle is perfect for you! Thanks Yankee Candle"
5,2016-02-22,Smells so homey and warm
3,2020-04-30,"I really wanted to love this candle because it's a yankee candle and a summery, fruit, strawberry scent which is my favourite... but this candle barely has a smell, it's very subtle at least and I was hoping for strong. Dont know if it's old or what. Only gave 3 stars though because it does have a slow burn time and I like the jar."
5,2016-10-19,Lovely scent
3,2015-12-12,Burned just fine. Arrived late.
2,2022-02-02,"I’m a big fan of Yankee Candles. That’s why this one surprised me by not burning evenly. After the wick was lit a few times, the wax started to fill the cavity that the wick made. Candle caused the candle to go out!!! Im not sure I want to buy another one. Is this a fluke or new way of manufacturing them."
3,2022-06-30,This particular fragrance has absolutely no scent at all while burning.  Try another Yankee Candle.  Lilac Blossoms is a terrific option.
4,2015-01-06,"love the smell...beware of the double wicks though, it cracked the glass...just save the wax for tealights"
3,2020-10-19,"It came really well packaged- so no fear of breaking. The scent I find pleasant but a very weak. Can't really get a sense of what the smell is as melted wax smell is stronger, I think I'll try a different one next time. Or may just have to get them at bed n bath where I can smell before buy."
4,2020-01-12,This is my favorite of the Yankee vanilla scented candles. It is amazing! I would've given this candle 5 stars for the smell alone but you do have to keep Yankee candles trimmed or they will smoke.
5,2016-09-05,Great product.
4,2022-03-02,Na
1,2018-12-23,"Either we got a bad/defective candle somehow, or this is a knock-off.  We burned it in our medium size living room for 3 hours and smelled literally nothing.  As a test we put it in our bathroom and closed the door.  After an hour i opened the door and i could *barely* smell a little vanilla.  Definitely not normal for a Yankee Candle. Disappointed.I had heard from several people that the Yankee French vanilla was traditionally a very strong and pleasant candle scent, so something is definitely not right here!"
1,2020-09-18,I bought this candle before and it smelled like Fall. This one has no scent.
4,2016-07-09,Smells great!
1,2018-12-15,"Ordered four candles.  Three were shattered.  Useless,"
4,2021-05-17,So strong in the cinnamon scent my mom wanted to send it back!
2,2022-01-18,Honestly this is the only time I have ever been disappointed in a Yankee candle.  Scent is horrible and kept thinking just burning awful so mething and waiting for smoke alarms to go off.  Cannot even describe how bad this one is!  Sticking with my Cranberry Chutney!
5,2012-01-20,Thank you for having this scent of candle online for purchase.  It was shipped well also.  A couple of my friends stationed with me received their candles busted in the mail.  Thanks again!!
5,2016-03-24,I love THE SCENT
4,2021-05-19,The scent is not as strong as this particular fragrance candle is from other stores.
5,2015-01-21,My most favorite of all the Yankee Candle scents.
4,2016-03-21,"Expensive as heck but I figure that's what you'd expect getting one of those better known name brands I wasn't too happy with the smell but it was bearable and lasted through the holidays which is what I wantedUpdate: from 2 to 4 stars, this is really an acquired smell for some I guess.. I want another one because I miss the old one so much."
4,2022-01-21,Mom liked it
5,2016-06-20,Bought this for my mother-in-law. She loves vanilla candles and needless to say that she loved this one too.
5,2020-02-28,The candles scent while lit is scrumptious!!
5,2015-09-30,Nice smelling fall candle!
4,2020-12-19,The scent used to be stronger than it currently is. Hopefully they did not change the formula
3,2019-03-15,Burn time was not what I thought it should be.
2,2018-10-24,"I give this a 4 star for value for money because the burn is nice and slow, the frangrance strong, and the size big. BUT... I honestly cant stand the smell! I bought 2 different brands of Pumpkin Spice candles before this (McCalls Country Canning and The Candle Daddy) trying to find my favorite for the best price and this smell was NOTHING like any other pumpkin spice candle i have ever smelled. It's super sweet like a fake sweet, like super strong candy smell.... It literally has made me nauseous. I've let it burn for 4 hours now, hoping that it would heat up and smell better, but definitely not. Maybe this particular scent is just not for me. Also, it arrived with some oily crud stuck all the way around the inner part of the lid, not a big deal, just gross."
4,2020-03-02,I've had mine burning for probably close to 30 hours overall and there's still about half of the wax left. The scent is fine and the item arrived perfectly packaged and undamaged. These would make great gifts!
5,2016-05-09,smells great
5,2017-12-18,gift
5,2015-02-03,Item as described. Fast shipping.
3,2020-10-01,"Here’s a pro tip. If you pay less than $20 retail for a large Yankee candle, it is going to be weakly scented. I would have to burn 10 of these autumn wreath candles for $16.99 in order to get the scent that I would for one regularly scented autumn wreath Yankee 22 ounce candle. Buyer beware."
3,2021-10-30,"I have purchased this particular scent from other places, and from Yankee Candle directly. This candle is a let down. I'm having a hard time believing that it is authentic. The scent is very weak."
3,2013-10-08,"We love Yankee candles and have always been loyal to the company.This candle smelled AMAZING after opening the lid. The boyfriend could smell it from across the room when I took it out of the packaging.However, this one does not seem to emit the same strength of scent while burning as previous Yankee candles for some reason.After having it lit for about 2 hours, there was not much a noticeable scent. Very disappointing.Perhaps with further burn it will get better."
5,2014-07-24,"smells great, arrived quickly and neat packing. would buy again."
4,2018-02-16,Disappointing - very little scent - scent is waxy - tried adding some Allspice but it had no affect - probably need some aromatic oil - large candle that does nothing to scent the house - probably save it to pull out when we have severe lightening storms in case we loose electricity.
5,2019-03-31,Smells amazing
4,2020-09-07,The candle melts to quickly.
2,2022-03-14,"I am a fan of Yankee Candle, but the Spiced Pumpkin candle does not smell like spiced pumpkin. It is not that it smells bad, it has very little scent.I'm really disappointed in Yankee Candle. This is not the quality I would expect from them!"
5,2018-02-15,Smells great one of our all time favorites
1,2020-09-01,I can’t smell it at all and I’m in the same room
5,2015-09-15,Great product!! Would recommend! Packaged well!!
5,2020-01-09,Smells so good.
4,2022-08-08,Good but too brulee
4,2021-04-15,Needed a little more cinnamon scent.Long burning.Nice gift.
5,2015-11-12,Smells like Fall!
5,2020-06-23,This  Yankee candle is stellar. The smell is fabulous.
5,2019-12-03,I love yankee candle
5,2017-12-05,"I buy a lot if Yankee candles and always have a nice stock on hand because I burn them all day. This one smells really good. It is a little different than the spiced pumpkin. It is more like a true pumpkin pie scent. I like it better than the spiced pumpkin. All of the ""spice"" type candles always smell weird to me after they burn for a while."
4,2020-10-08,The spiced pumpkin sent does not seem to be aS strong as other Yankee candles that we have tried. I still love them and they are my favorite but I probably won’t get spiced pumpkin again.
5,2015-01-28,Love it. Smells fantastic.
5,2018-12-11,Great fall fragrance
5,2018-11-09,Love the scent!
5,2019-12-10,This is my favorite scent!!! Everyone who comes over agrees!
5,2018-11-06,The real deal.
4,2020-02-06,"I have purchased the spiced pumpkin scent before and this was definitely not the same scent , this one reminded me of how a burnt jackolantern smells ."
4,2018-04-20,I love the smell. Great quality and good buy. 👍
5,2014-11-13,Long burn time and smells great.
5,2013-01-20,Bought this to fit in a pillar stand purchased from a Yankee Candle school fundraiser. This particular size is not easy to find in local stores. Fit perfectly and smells wonderful.
1,2020-08-12,Received broken jar of candle.
1,2020-05-24,Please don’t by this scent. Home Sweet Home it is NOT.  It smells like an old man cologne. It just stinks!!!! I didn't return it because I lit it/ used. Recommend not to buy this candle scent unless you like old guy cologne smell. Lol
5,2015-12-14,Best candle
5,2014-09-01,"Just as expected, but better!"
5,2018-01-13,"Because of allergies, this event is one of my favorites!  It doesn't bother me at all."
4,2019-01-18,"not as strong a scent as Yankee used to be (esp. this scent), but it works for me 'cause the heavier-scented candles bother my spouse's allergies.  still, scent fills the house & smells great when I walk in the door."
4,2020-07-24,...was excellently done.
1,2022-04-17,"This was my first time buying a Yankee Candle, they were a too spendy for me.  But, it was my birthday and I always wanted to try them.  So, I ordered it....Worst present I have ever given myself.It was even cinnamon, truly expected it to be an intense smell.... but, no!If you stick your nose directly inside jar, you can faintly get a hint of cinnamon.When burning, NO SMELL!I could have purchased 4 jar candles at Wal-Mart for the price of this one!  (SAME SIZE JAR.)Can guarantee I will stick wirh them next time."
5,2017-01-07,My favorite scent
5,2015-04-29,Smells amazing!
5,2019-06-27,It's great to get a fall fragrance
4,2021-01-11,"Strong smell, long lasting but I deducted one star coz I got big hands and can't fit my hand in there to light it when it gets low."
3,2021-03-07,The candle came with a broke sharp edge but I kept it. The fragrance does not fill my apartment - I was really hoping for a vanilla cookie fragrance but I can barely smell any - disappointed
3,2021-12-04,"I like Yankee candles, they usually have a great smell and it laughs but this one that I bought the vanilla cupcake smell was very light and not strong enough."
4,2015-05-02,Love the smell
2,2021-10-28,"I’m not sure about this scent and if it will smell. The scented oil from candle leaked in jar, lid and outside of the jar. Not sure what happened or if candle was stored too long.I did light it and it does smell, but, I’m not sure if it’s pumpkin spice."
3,2019-08-19,"This is by far my favorite Vanilla scent in a candle. But unfortunately it just doesn't smell the room up very well. So it is half burned and in my closet. I could pick a bath and body works candle, or even a glade candle works better and is what I use. Maybe it was just mine."
4,2019-12-06,"These are very good candles, but the holidays are over rated, there are many other scents that are actually very pleasant. This one is just bearable."
5,2015-06-27,I love this scent and these were a great bargain. Thanks
2,2014-12-10,only lightly scented
5,2015-05-06,This arrived quickly and safely!
5,2016-01-26,great
5,2020-01-14,"Was a Xmas gift for my gf and she loved it, smells amazing!"
5,2020-12-30,wow
5,2015-07-06,Great candles
5,2015-10-13,Love it
2,2022-02-23,"Pretty sure they are watering ingredients, bought it before and smell was great and longer but now doesn’t even smell its like a fake yankee and not worth your money"
5,2015-12-30,Nice.  Love this scent.
3,2021-11-17,"The burn is low and the flame is super small. The scent doesn't really have the vibrancy that other Yankee candles in the vanilla family do, it's not bad it's just more subtle"
1,2021-12-21,"The two candles I bought are sitting in the exact spot I always put the candles I buy directly from Yankee. Even so, they burned down the middle like cheap candles.  I had to scrap the wax off the sides to fill in the cavern. That helped somewhat build the sides, but the wick is spent.  Huge waste of money. They smell great and look great until you start using them. Reviews on the Yankle Candle website show the same poor quality feedback. I contacted Yankee Xandke and was told the Amazon Store that's called Yankee Candke isn't Yankee Candle. So, no guarantees.  And the Amazon ""Yankee Candle"" won't reply."
5,2020-01-29,"Sweet and relaxiable.  For me, it just like  my grandmom‘s kitchen."
2,2022-08-11,Love the fragrance but the wick doesn't dissolve during burning and makes a lot of black smoke even after trimming it. I left it somewhat near my white wall and had to wash off the soot residue.
5,2019-03-12,Great value. Nice strong throw of warm coconut scent. Very pleased.
4,2016-01-10,"The harvest scent is most pleasant, and visitors always comment on how nice it smells.  The only problem was that when it was shipped, I suspect that the candle was affected by extreme heat somewhere, as some of the candle had melted into the lid to the point that it leaked outside of the glass container before it arrived to me."
5,2014-11-21,Favorite smell
3,2022-05-28,Candle arrived packaged well. Burns very even and long burn time. The only drawback is that it doesn’t have a scent. Barely any scent at all.
2,2022-04-01,"I usually buy natural candles but they're too expensive, so after reading so many good reviews I decided to try the Yankee candle in vanilla cupcake. Wow, I wish I went for my regular candles... The scent is really dominant and reminds me of those cheap car freshners you'll encounter on a random taxi drive that will make you want to get off as fast as possible cause the nauseating scent will give you an headache."
3,2020-11-14,"Not sure if this is authentic? The pumpkin spice scent smells very weak compared to my other Yankee Candles that usually fill my home with lovely scents. This scent is amazing when you sniff the candle but it doesn't disperse well...disappointing. Good burn life, though."
4,2018-01-12,First few times i lit it I could not smell much.  After that the fragrance came through.  Not as strongas others but decent enough. Nice homely kitchen baking smell.
3,2021-06-28,"I purchased the vanilla cupcake scent. It smells great cold, but once lit has next to no throw. I have it sitting on a shelf a couple feet away from my desk, and I forget that I have it lit."
5,2015-08-02,Great!
3,2019-11-01,The scent of this candle is very weak compared to the other scented candles I own. The scent won't fill your room
4,2019-02-15,Smells good but a bit too expensive since it burns to quickly
4,2018-01-28,Good smell though a bit overspriced
4,2021-03-09,I gave it as a gift.  I have not gotten any feedback.
1,2021-08-25,"When I was a kid at the mall the yankee candle stores were a great place to visit to pick out a candle that would fill your house with amazing smells! However, yankee candle now is like cable television old, outdated, and not worth the price! Even at the discount price of this candle it is a dud.  No smell, just plain hot wax burning away.  Yankee candle what happened to you?Oh well, lesson learned about listening to the reviews saying these candles sucked. On the bright side, at least I have a large power outage candle to use for years to come….#do better yankee candle"
4,2018-08-18,Smells great.
4,2020-04-12,"Great scent, but could be a bit stronger"
3,2021-02-03,"I think it was old , not the lovely smell you expect from a yankee candle. Cheap price maybe that's why."
5,2018-12-14,My boyfriend and I LOVE this scent. It's very cozy and is our favorite. We are bummed you can't really get it anymore. It burns evenly and lasts quite a while.
1,2020-01-20,"Yankee Candle's Home Sweet Home was my favorite scented candle anywhere.  I loved the cinnamon smell.  I have not had a scented candle for years, since this fragrance was hard to find in local stores.  When I found it on amazon, I ordered it.  The appearance of the candle was not as dark a red as I remembered; however, the most disappointing aspect - hardly any smell.  Yankee Candles were always known for their strong scents, and this one didn't really have any.  I had purchased another Yankee candle from a local store around the holidays, and this one really didn't provide much fragrance either.  Perhaps these candles were well past their use dates."
2,2020-01-12,"I took a chance and bought myself this candle for my birthday (Buttercream scent, large jar) As I should have expected, this candle had very little scent throw. Most Yankee Candles I've bought have also had very reduced, if nonexistent scent, but I just wanted to try again. Nice looking candle and nice burn too. Too bad YC didn't add more fragrance, so it wouldn't be just another candle. Am returning."
3,2018-04-29,"Ordered for a son who is a fan of everything vanilla.We were greatly disappointed with this Yankee.Surprisingly weak scent, barely noticeable after hours of burn.I would rate the scent strength 2 out of 5.The most fragrant from our large collection of Yankees so far were Caramel and Chocolate Layer Cake.Will never buy this  scent again."
5,2015-06-06,This is one of my favorite candles. :)
4,2020-04-11,Very disappointed. The scent was very weak. It burnt good and smells good on the jar BUT not when you burn it.
5,2013-11-25,Best scent for Autumn! A wonderful light pumpkin smell. I have been using Yankee candles for the last 17 years and always can count on the excellent quality and consistent scent. Delivery was faster than expected.
5,2020-02-17,"As described, with quick delivery"
3,2019-11-10,"1st candle I bought was great, 640 square ft and within 30 minutes the entire apartment smells wonderful.  Bought a 2nd large Jar Candle that unfortunately, was not as good as the first candle. A third of the way down the candle turned white and started to smell different. These candles seem to be hit or miss"
5,2016-11-14,Smell great and arrived in perfect condition!
3,2020-05-02,I was hoping for a strong scent and when you open it then it smells great but when you light it then it’s super easy to forget about it because you can’t smell it at all. Upsetting because that’s never been an issue with Yankee candles before but I guess they can’t all be winners.
4,2021-02-16,This candle made my whole October smell delicious ty
4,2021-07-23,Smells good but light
5,2017-02-06,Favorite hard to find scent. Arrived packaged safely and quickly.
5,2014-12-08,Smells great!
4,2020-01-26,"Weak Scent. Was expecting more. Burns clean. ONLY MELTED IN THE CORE, LEFT MAJOR WAX ON THE SIDES. Very short burn time."
3,2018-09-12,"I ordered this candle for my friend for her birthday this Saturday and it came in the mail like this today.  I opened the package and was amazed of how even the box smelled before I opened it completely.  I pulled out the cardboard that protects the candle and it’s covered in red oil and I thought to myself “Oh, this can’t be good!” Then I opened the cardboard and saw that the candle had melted on its side and the wick is completely covered and I am not able to take the top off!"
4,2015-09-01,"The fragrance is not overpowering, yet still spreads evenly over your room.  It burns for the length of time on the package.  As with most candles there will be about a 1/2 "" left in the bottom that floods the wick and puts out the candle.  For the best performance, keep the wick short. A very nice candle for the price."
2,2016-01-19,Smell is awful even for a bacon lover
3,2020-10-02,"Great scent. Unfortunately, like another Yankee candle of mine, it began tunneling, so even draining wax it will soon drown before its time. Yankee has gone cheap with their wicks. So I bought proper size wicks to transplant, so the candle doesn't go to waste."
5,2019-02-09,I adore the candle 😗😗😗
1,2018-08-06,Opened the package the glass was busted and on top of that the candle had no wick
1,2021-12-28,"I purchased this candle to have a lovely scent over Christmas. However, it did not have a strong scent. No, I'm not sick and I can smell everything just fine and I'm not Covid or Omicron infected like everyone is blaming it on. Not happy with this weak candle!! Will not purchase again!"
3,2020-01-08,I bought the Sparkling Cinnamon candle.  I was very disappointed.  The candled burned straight down and I could only smell cinnamon when I got right up on the candle.  When I blew it out it let off a good amount of black smoke which has never happened before with Yankee candles.  Don't waste your money.
3,2022-05-09,"I've had better luck with candles I bought at Walmart, these barely smell in my small room."
3,2021-12-03,This candle was not up to the quality of the previous one (same kind) that I purchased. It was unevenly colored and the scent was not as strong (although just as lovely). Glad I didn’t purchase it as a gift for someone. Something must have happened to it in transit or it was poorly stored at the warehouse.
4,2019-02-16,Good
4,2020-03-09,Could have stronger scent
5,2017-09-07,Love this scent. Burns EVENLY and SLOWLY all the way to the bottom.
1,2020-09-05,"I'm not sure what's going on with this candle. I've ordered this fragrance, Home Sweet Home, many times from Yankee Candle. The scent is always strong and pleasant and fills the entire house with fragrance.  This candle had no scent. It smells like it should when I take the lid off, but when I burn it- nothing.I purchased 2 of these and both have no fragrance when lit.  I won't purchase these from Amazon again."
1,2022-02-13,"I don’t understand Yankee candles. Some of them have virtually no scent. I don’t know if some fragrances are weak or if there is a quality control issue within a scent. If I put this right under my nose, I can smell a little bit of cinnamon. It’s a candy smell like Big Red. However, there is zero scent lit. I can’t even smell anything within inches of it."
4,2021-11-05,This is a lovely smell and the candle last longer!!!
4,2013-10-04,"This is a nice Yankee candle which offers an aroma of autumn that is both pleasurable and soothing. I dunno though, I buy this scent every year, but this time it smells more like cinnamon than pumpkin. The candle also arrived partially melted and was a little messy. But, ya know, it's a candle and it still  serves it's purpose so I give it four stars."
1,2013-04-27,"I love bacon.  Perhaps more than any man should.  I even use the grease to fry eggs or mix in with a sausage gravy and biscuits.  Nothing goes to waste.  When I die, I want to be wrapped with bacon and mummified with it.I also love Yankee Candle.  I'm especially a fan of their foods scented candles.  Christmas Cookie and Campfire Treat being my absolute favorites.  But Yankee Candle really dropped the ball on this one.The candle, before even lit, is a horrid scent.  Picture Beggin' Strips bacon smell, and concentrate that in a jar.  Now, add a flame, and what you get is an overwhelming smell that smells like a cross being Beggin' Strips and garbage...on fire.I paid $32 for this?  I don't know if Yankee Candle will accept it as a trade for a new one.  I only lit it once.  Never again.  The next time I want my house to smell like bacon...I'll fry up the real thing.  At least then, I'll also have the enjoyment of eating bacon!"
3,2020-12-07,The lid had melted wax on it and spashed at my computer screen after I removed the lid. Please make sure that your items aren't melted before shipping out or are in need condition. This candles look used before.
1,2015-01-17,No wick
4,2020-05-15,"Yeah, that is the only problem. It smells so good, just like salted caramel. Like baking cookies."
5,2015-07-21,Great product and great price!
3,2021-02-27,I thought the scent would be stronger....except for when you stick your nose close to the jar.  it last long.  looks good.  very durable.  but was hoping the scent would fill up the room more.
3,2021-03-01,I’ve been buying  this exact candle for over 10 years and the scent of it has declined I can’t smell it unless I’m close to the candle which has never happened in the past. Disappointed
5,2015-02-24,"Great candle.  Arrived in a larger box with no packing material.  Luckily, unbroken."
4,2020-12-15,Smells amazing they arent as strong as bath and body works candles but for the and size its a good deal
1,2018-11-05,It doesn’t smell anything like a Yankee Candle Buttercream Candle
3,2020-11-18,"I had the ‘same’ scent (Apple Pumpkin) that I purchased in store and though this one is close, something about it is definitely not the same. Bummer since the cost was nearly as much. Unfortunately, I don’t plan to purchase from here again."
5,2015-05-18,Love it
1,2022-08-18,"It's been a while since I purchased a Yankee Candle.  Back in the day they were the go to scented candles around holidays and the scent of the candles in the big jars filled the whole room.  I ordered 2 big jars of Yankee Candles, one the Sparking Cinnamon and the other Cinnamon Stick.  I lit both of them and burned them in my master bedroom all night long and there was hardly even any hint of cinnamon in the air!From what I heard online through scented candle enthusiasts is that the Yankee Candle Company is under new management and owners and more than likely began to cut corners and cut back on the fragrances in the candles and use inferior materials.  I'm more sad and disappointed than I am angry and frustrated wasting my money on these candles when I have bought large jar scented candles at Wal-Mart at a fraction of the cost that had a great scent and good scent throw.I will never to back to Yankee Candle."
3,2018-11-30,The candle arrived as promised. It was packaged in an eggshell type box inside another box like all these type candles come.  My wife likes the scent which is very strong.  These candles last a long time which is why I like them and the scent does not go away. But does not burn even. 1/2 inch on one side does not burn. Half way through and it is still there.
2,2021-06-29,"I always loved Yankee Candles for their beautiful smells.  This was a lightning deal so I grabbed it.  It did not smell like anything, just a candle on my desk.  I even let it burn overnight in my room, and there was absolutely no scent in the morning."
1,2021-03-17,"So sad and disappointed. My 86 yo Mother asked me to use her recent Amazon birthday gift card to buy her some of those ""good & strong"" scented Yankee candles. I bought her 2 ... the Honey Clementine one was acceptable but this one ... the Vanilla Cupcake has almost ZERO SCENT. The worse part is that she especially enjoys the Vanilla scent. I'm not sure if it's an Amazon problem with an old candle or a Yankee Candle problem but this one was a total waste of money."
5,2020-06-18,Smells amazing!
2,2021-02-06,I have bought hundreds of Yankee candles through the years and this particular candle doesn't seem like a Yankee at all. It has no scent and burns much more quickly than usual. I would not recommend purchasing this scent at least. I will definitely not purchase in the future.
5,2014-12-31,Smells great!
1,2019-11-06,"Does not smell like coffee, lasted 1 week. definitely not buying again"
4,2020-03-09,I got the lavender. The smell was not that strong lasted long. I expected to smell to be a little stronger
5,2017-12-12,Smells great!
2,2015-12-12,"I didn't like this candle, it didn't smell very good and the smell wasn't noticeable."
5,2018-07-28,Liked well enough
5,2018-12-12,Nice smellung
4,2020-11-14,Smells great in my kitchen but smell dosent last long.
4,2020-09-21,"I am a long time yankee candle lover and so when I saw this spiced pumpkin on sale, I had to grab it! The scent is wonderful and perfect for fall!y only issue is that it is burning down quicker than most other YC typically do. But I’m enjoying it while it lasts!!"
2,2018-01-05,"I have always bought Yankee candles because I can count on a good strong scent that will travel to several rooms. For whatever reason, these (I bought 2) don't have the same strong smell. It is there, faintly, after the candle has burned for quite awhile, but only if you're in close proximity to the candle. It won't stop me from buying them, just not this one again."
3,2022-04-19,This one has a little more scent than other Yankee candles but still not worth the cost.
3,2020-11-15,If you stand over it you can smell it.  Otherwise forget it.  Yankee candles have really gone downhill.
3,2020-10-06,This pumpkin spice and the Apple pumpkin candles we lurches just do not have much scent. I think we are going to stop purchasing yankee candles. I would not purchase these. The autumn leaves we purchase does have good scent
5,2016-05-23,I love this candle! I have bought it several times. By far my favorite!
4,2021-03-29,Smells delicious
5,2018-10-07,Came exactly as expected!
4,2019-09-19,Candle came melted. It was covered in melted candle inside and out
3,2022-01-19,I burned this for a couple says now and it doesn’t seem to have much of a scent. I do not recommend this one
3,2019-01-28,Not my kinda sent but giftable
3,2021-10-26,This was not in good condition when I got it.  It was a gift for my daughter and she told me it broke easily after she got it out.
1,2018-09-21,I ordered 4 yankee candles. Three of them had melted via shipping. They melted so much that I cannot see the wick to light them.
1,2019-04-18,"Yankee Candle's primary claim to fame was always their marvelous scents. This Salted Caramel ""scented"" candle has none. The only scent you'll detect is if you stick your nose into the jar before lighting. Yes, there's a scent there, but no matter how long you burn it, you're never going to get to enjoy Salted Caramel or any other scent wafting about your room. It's just not there. And yes, my sense of smell is still good, thank you for asking. Also, the Yankee Candle makers, like all candle makers, used to know how to gauge the thickness of their wicks so that they burned down at the same rate that the wax melted. The company has stopped concerning themselves with that nicety since they've decided it's really their customers' job to constantly trim the wicks. If you overlook that, next thing you know, a six-inch flame will be shooting out of the jar threatening to crack it and/or set your curtains or something else on fire. Yankee Candle has evidently lost interest in selling a quality product. That might be all right if they had the decency to reduce their prices accordingly because their new product is  only worth the price of the jar. That, at least, can be used for something. I've loved Yankee Candles for more than 40 years, but now I'm looking for a candle maker who still knows how to make candles."
5,2013-09-28,"I looooove this scent! It smells absolutely delicious, like a sweet pumpkin dessert! It's definitely the perfect candle for fall!"
5,2019-12-13,My favorite scent and it's hard to find in the stores.
4,2018-06-19,my husband who loves chocolate loves this candle. i don’t like it because it smells like tootsie rolls
4,2017-12-30,Smells wonderful!
3,2019-01-09,"I love this scent from Yankee, but the candle shape is a huge issue.  It never burns correctly.  I'm doing everything I should be, by trimming the wick, etc, noted on their website.  Unfortunately, there's a TON of wax on the side that never burns down.  I'm going to stick with the straight version from now on, even though it costs more."
2,2021-01-01,"We’ve loved Yankee Candles for decades and always felt like they were worth paying more for due to the superior quality and fragrances. But they seem to have changed their formula recently. Buttercream was our favorite scent, but now smells like maple syrup ?? Maybe we just got a bad or old one but we probably won’t try again as the scent is pretty awful."
2,2019-10-02,"I love Yankee and will recommend Yankee all day long.  The scents, the hours the scent lasts and the candles burn evenly.  However, I was extremely hesitant in ordering a glass jar candle online but I couldn't pass up the price.  Unfortunately, my fears came true...the candle arrived with a broken jar.  The crack is lower then the candle so instead of taking my chances on melting wax all over my end table it'll probably end up in garbage."
3,2021-12-31,"The candle burns as they have in the past but usually they make my house smell wonderful, but not this one."
5,2016-11-13,Great odor and long lasting. Worth the price over other candle makers.
3,2021-12-26,"The candle was pretty, but that is it.  It didn’t affect how the room smelled, at all.  Extremely disappointed"
3,2019-01-28,"typically not a problem, but the scent from this candle is very strong.. It lingers around too, for almost 2 fulls days I was smelling Salted Caramel. I used in a smaller room so results might be different in a large open area."
4,2013-09-28,"This candle is STRONG and smells amazingly good.  Packaged well, my only gripe would be that the oils did melt during shipment and got all over the packaging.  Very sticky and slick to unpack.  I have a prime account, and received it in one day, so it's not like it sat in the heat during shipment for too long."
2,2021-04-04,The candle did smell like chocolate cake but it has a strange corn undertone that can't be ignored.  I'm not sure if it was a bad batch but I was dissapointed as I have been searching for a chocolate candle. Right now it's just being used as a decoration.
5,2020-03-08,Great candle
2,2021-11-30,Candle wax was melted and slid as it resolidified  so it covers most the wick. The lid didn't seal good because its lined with melted wax. It fell off as I was moving the candle and it shattered! The wax is all bubbly. Not sure if i will be able to salvage this candle.
4,2020-07-24,Good for the price but was hoping it would smell a bit stronger
4,2020-01-06,It smells good. It's your typical yankee candle. Downside is that it came covered in wax splatters. Looks like something messed up during manufacturing
5,2020-02-11,"Smells great, easy to wrap!"
4,2020-02-15,Smells great and is a large candle.  Definitely worth it when you can find them on sale.
4,2017-12-17,"I like the scent itself very much. Warm pumpkin smell with a bit of cinnamon. It could have been a little bit more intense for me, therefore only 4 stars, but definitely one I would buy again."
5,2016-02-07,Wonderful fragrance.
2,2020-04-06,"I purchased a large, $25, two-wick, tumbler candle in French Vanilla. I burned it for six hours on two different occasions.  Both times there was NO SCENT: Non, Nein, Niet Nahi, NO SCENT! I had always heard that Yankee Candle was the best of candle manufacturers, but it seems I heard wrong.  I will not purchase Yankee Candle products again."
5,2019-10-23,"It smells great, is a great gift, and it last really long"
5,2015-08-04,Smells good enough to eat!
3,2021-02-11,"I am very disappointed in Yankee Candles as their candles are not what they used to be. Seems like the price continues to rise however, the scent of the candles are not as strong as they once were.  I used to be able to burn one candle to fragrance my entire house (one level Rancher) but now, one candle barely covers my open concept kitchen & livingroom! I'm definitely going to look into a different company to purchase future candles from."
1,2014-10-13,"Terrible!!!!! Obviously they sent me an old candle that had lost its scent. Not really sure,  never had one that you couldn't smell at all and this one normally has a very strong scent."
1,2020-10-13,"I love the scent of Home Sweet Home. It's perfect to get you in the holiday spirit.  However, my experience mirrors that of numerous other reviews: this candle is the weakest Yankee Candle I've ever smelled.  With every other Yankee Candle, after one is lit, I can smell it throughout the entire house.  With this one, the only way I can smell it is if I bend down over the candle and take a deep whiff while it's burning.I've never had a problem with Yankee Candle's QC before.  This leads me to believe that my candle is either counterfeit or several years old."
5,2013-04-03,Bought the candle without knowing how it would smell. Lucked out. It smells awesome. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
4,2018-02-15,"Love Yankee candle. This scent I was looking forward too because is vanilla, well the scent would be good for a small small area. Most Yankee candles fill the entire home, this one fell short on the scent."
2,2020-11-07,I was expecting a nice strong scent throughout the house but this candle was a let down especially for the price. The scent is not that good like other candle brands and not nearly as aromatic when lit.
2,2022-04-12,Was hoping to fill my small apartment with this kind of sugary scent. Price was right. But I don’t smell anything. Not sure why. Guess it’s a bad batch.
4,2017-12-06,"A mellow cinnamon scent with good ""throw.""  Burns evenly, without tunneling, though mine did not burn all the way down completely, leaving about 1/4"" of wax on the bottom after the wick went out."
1,2016-08-04,did not last long enough
1,2021-08-06,this is the crappiest candle i’ve ever gotten. i’ve used other candles in this scent and they were very powerful. i let this candle burn for over 4 hours and it still give off any kind of scent. this i have no idea how they have so many good reviews on this scent. maybe i got a really bad batch but i will NEVER IN LIFE PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!
2,2022-03-07,"I don't know about you, but I am use to the Yankee candles that are so over powering the smell lasts even after you smudge out the flame. This candle was not giving what it was supposed to give."
1,2021-08-14,"This candle has no scent! I won't buy another yankee candle. They are expensive garbage. Choose another brand and read the reviews before buying, I didn't because of yankee candles rep. As far as I am concerned, that reputation is ill deserved."
2,2020-11-09,"I love the candle and the scent. However, the base was broken in many pieces. You could hear the glass clanking in the box, so I'm not sure why it was delivered this way."
2,2020-11-03,"It doesn’t smell as the ones I buy at the store, the scent it’s so subtle and doesn’t linger as the other I have from store. Perhaps is fake? I don’t know, but I’ll no but anymore from here."
4,2018-02-09,Yankee Candles are just the best candles ever!
4,2018-08-31,"This candles smells divine, but I wish it had a little stronger smell when burned. Still, my favorite Yankee candle."
4,2022-05-25,I enjoy that this candle can be used in all seasons for any occasion. Scent is great and fills my home very well without being overwhelming.
4,2015-04-29,"Home Sweet Home is one of my favorite Yankee Candle scents.  It smells mostly of cinnamon and effuses my home with a fragrance that isn't floral that can aggravate my allergies.  I also prefer cinnamon over sweet fruity scents.  It lasts for a good long time and scents the room even when it is not lit.  A Yankee Candle is one of my go-to gifts to send to friends and family via Amazon.  If you're a huge fan of Yankee Candles, I would recommend visiting their website as they are often running sales on their various products."
1,2020-11-15,"Even thought this candle lasts for a very long time, the scent is not very strong. I keep this candle in my bedroom, and I usually keep my bedroom door closed. Normally, the smell of most candles will envelope my room and my roommates will compliment the smell when they pass by, however, there is no smell wafting or emanating from my room with this candle.Also, since there is only one wick in this candle, it melted unevenly. It was kind of unsightly to look at. I tried hard to even out the candle but scraping the unmelted wax off, but sometimes it wouldn’t budge. Overall, I don’t recommend this candle."
3,2020-10-29,Not a very strong scent. I like the smell but doesn’t seem to be as well as I like them
1,2022-03-15,This candle barely has any scent.  I just bought the same candle about a month before and it was cheaper and had fantastic vanilla scent and lasted long. What happened?
1,2017-09-06,"Package arrived with nothing to protect the candle, broken in pieces..."
5,2016-11-21,Best scent every by Yankee Candle
5,2019-04-07,Halfway burned out but still smells great.
5,2013-05-07,"Awesome scent, ample sized jar, great quality product.....will by more in the future. Thanks so much!A brand name to trust. thanks, Jules"
5,2018-11-25,Love
4,2020-01-26,It smells good and burns a long time. Strong scent but not as sting as I like
4,2020-02-04,Wonderful scent but it didn't last that long at all which is a huge let down.
3,2018-04-14,Love this scent.
4,2021-01-19,Scent is pretty good. Yankee candles are the best brand out there
4,2019-12-13,Our favorite scent Yankee offers.  Only took a star off because their price is so high.
5,2015-09-25,Wow wouldn't love a yankee candle? They ARE the best.
1,2021-07-13,"I'm used to Bath and Body Works candles and have always heard that Yankee is basically the best brand out there, so I thought I would try the vanilla cupcake one. I can hardly smell anything when it's lit! Bath and Body Works candles fill up my entire apartment, this Yankee one does nothing. I might as well bought a cheap dollar store candle because it's about the same."
4,2019-06-30,"Very long lasting, not too strong scent wise"
5,2017-01-19,Pleasant scent
5,2019-03-13,Home ambionce
1,2021-12-05,"I have ordered many Yankee Candles from Amazon. The first thing I do when I get one is open the lid and take a big whiff. I'm always happy until this time. The only smell I got was unscented wax. Very disappointing. I like to light a candle at night and this one was listed at a good price, plus I've used this fragrance many, many times before. I know exactly what it smells like. The jar I got was nothing but unscented wax. Too bad. I was really looking forward to burning it."
2,2021-05-30,The quality has diminished significantly over the years. Paid too much money for too much smoke and too little scent. I have been Yankee Candle customer for over 25 years and this purchase was my final one.
4,2021-12-07,Smells great but not worth the 20.00 price tag.
1,2022-02-18,"I've been buying this candle for 15 years and know the scent well, and this was not the right scent. It smells like caramel and when lit for a few hours also did not fill the room with scent like most Yankee candles do. I've read many other people now saying this is a issue they've had with this candle in the past year or so. I contacted Yankee about the smell difference and they had nothing helpful to say unfortunately. I returned it and ended up finding their lower-end Home Accents buttercream at the grocery store and it had the correct smell. If you don't like caramel, be wary of buying this."
2,2019-07-03,Was melted when it arrived
5,2018-11-03,Good price
2,2018-04-20,"Let me start by saying no one loves Yankee Candles more than me.  I swear by them.  The strength of the fragrance, the scents, and overall quality/burn time.  Unfortunately, I find that when I buy them anywhere other than directly from their store or site, the quality is compromised.  Not sure if they’re selling the defects to outside sellers or wholesalers but this candle didn’t smell like they usually do.  Maybe it was just a coincidence or bad batch’s."
3,2013-04-09,"The soy-based wax in this candle looks creamier but the smell is not the same as the paraffin-only wax in the housewarmer series, I'm disappointed with the smell compared tomy other buttercream candle"
3,2021-01-09,"I have a sensitive nose and I feel this candle has an inferior scent to Bath and Body Works candles, but has a longer burn time. The scent is good, but weak."
2,2018-12-03,"First time using yankee candle so was very excited but what a let down.I have a small apartment, only 500 Sqft, so I was hoping the candle would spread throughout but it I can’t even smell it when I sit on the couch 10 feet away. Even when I walk past it the smell is very light.Back to “Our own candle company” I go."
2,2021-10-17,"Delivery driver was great.  He noticed some wax that leaked out of my box and suggested I open it immediately in case it the jar was cracked.  It wasn't,  the candle was packed upside down and Florida heat made the candle st as it to leak out from poorly placed lid. I was thinking about ordering more prior to this delivery as presents , but not after this experience.I didn't return it because it was still functional but just not pretty."
4,2020-02-19,Love these candles but only when they are deeply discounted.
4,2021-06-14,Did not like the scent
2,2020-10-11,"I ordered the Pumpkin spice.  Upon opening the jar, the smell was pleasant.  After burning it for about an hour there was zero scent in the room where I had it.  I usually buy Bath and Body works and will be going back after this disappointing experience."
3,2020-10-04,"These candles are on sale for a reason, they are defective with air bubbles and holes. You can clearly see that they wouldn't sell at their store. Maybe they are old..."
4,2020-08-09,got this at a good price
1,2021-08-27,Look at how this item was received.  Completely damaged and useless.  Amazon has deleted several of my reviews for this product that included pictures of this item (which I will include again).  This is a defective product and I will also leave negative feedback about the seller and AMAZON who has REFUSED TO REFUND!
4,2018-05-09,"The candle was great as far as aroma, but it arrived broken.  I returned it locally, and there were no more cinnamon candles so I had to find another fragrance."
4,2019-08-30,Smells great
3,2015-09-18,FAIR DEAL
3,2021-12-26,Smells amazing and would have been a great gift for my wife for Christmas but it melted and can't be burnt. It must have melted in transit. She is taking the wax and just putting it in her wax warmer so over all didn't go to waste. Just disappointed.
4,2022-03-13,Nice purchase.
2,2019-12-14,Always buy Yankee candles because you get what you pay for until I bought this one....for some reason it's not melting on the side of the jar.1st candle I bought on amazon.I don't get it and considering returning it.very disappointed.
3,2022-01-04,"Bought, for convienance sake.  But no scent when candel is lit."
1,2018-04-26,Candle came melted to one side of the jar & without a wick inside as well.
2,2021-11-15,"For as much as Yankee Candles cost, I should be able to smell it throughout my whole apartment; however, that is not the case. The smell is faint and does not compare to the $5 Glade candles that I typically buy. $50 for two candles! Never again!"
3,2021-01-12,"The price was great; however, it barely created a faint scent.  It burned out faster than anticipated.  I believe these candles are overrated."
2,2019-08-29,Love the scent of the candle but no thought was given on packaging.  The candle was shipped to be on it's side and so it melted and buried the wick. I had to carve out quite a bit of the soft candle(it was still soft from the heat of the current weather) and have tried lighting candle and moving it so that melted wax will drip into the side of container that is missing the wax. This is going to take a lot of time. Very dissappointed.
4,2020-01-06,Wonderful candle for a wonderful price! The smell was amazing
3,2021-05-08,It’s a great candle and last a while problem is it’s not a very heavy sent you really can barely smell the cinnamon smell
1,2020-02-03,"I have bought this candle several times but this time there just is barely any fragrance????? I normally buy from Kohl’s or Marshall’s or even Home Goods but this has been the worst Yankee Candle ever. I wasted my money - Generally always happy with Yankee Candle products and have Never had a complaint so this is a first.Update, Amazon replaced my item and refunded my money back! How awesome is that!  As I said I am a faithful Yankee Candle Girl  and I remain a buyer to this day and haven’t had a bad experience since and have purchased dozen’s of candles!"
4,2020-07-24,...was excellently done
4,2020-07-28,Did not have a very strong smell. Does last along time.
2,2022-08-02,This must be an old product because I’ve never had a Yankee candle disappoint. It had no smell at all.
3,2021-01-20,"I was searching for something similar to the scent of cinnamon crumb cake. I'd hope this was it, but the cinnamon was way too strong. It made my stomach hurt. My big sis likes it though. Said it smelled like a vanilla mocha or something."
1,2020-04-28,I have bought French Vanilla Yankee Candles for years. I have multiple candles going constantly. I love the way it makes my home smell. I get lots of compliments. Due to C-19 the store I get them from is closed. I ordered 6 candles through Amazon Services. I am currently burning two. They are either knock offs or rejects!  GUARANTEED!  I did a test. I started two candles in my home and worked outside for three hours. I came back into house and could barely smell anything. Something is wrong with these candles.Amending two weeks afternoon burning. These candles suck and provide no scent. Total rip off.  Do not buy.
5,2017-09-04,love this scent
3,2021-11-16,I buy Yankee Candles all the time. These miss the mark. It must be a Mankee Candles!
3,2022-06-13,Yankee to me is known for that long lasting since but this cupcake smell  to me didn’t really give off a scent
3,2020-11-05,"I burned the scented candle all day and can barely smell it in the small room it's in. I know I have my sense of smell working fine, so it's not that."
3,2015-09-19,"When this candle arrived, it had melted and the wick was buried under the melted, then hardened wax.  I had to microwave the candle until the wax melted, suspend the wick with a paper clip until the wax hardened.  Now the candle burns at an angle with the wax only melting down on one side. I have a lopsided candle that smells really good."
3,2021-08-19,Very disappointed with the smell being extremely light. Normally when I have a yankee candle lit I can smell it in 2-3 rooms. This 1 you have to be standing next to it to smell it. Even hrs after it’s been burning. Very disappointed.
1,2018-09-17,"This candle appears to be the Yankee Candle brand sold at Walmart and other box stores.  There is very little scent, if any, and what scent is there is not long-lasting.  It also appears to be an older candle as areas of the wax are discolored.  Needless to say I am disappointed in the product and the vendor."
3,2021-12-23,The scent isn't as strong as it was when first used
5,2015-05-26,I love my pumpkin Candle!!!!!!!!!!!
5,2015-03-31,loves good.
3,2021-11-11,The candle lasts a good long time but there was no scent to it.
2,2020-08-18,"I orders 4 and 2 came melted with oils that leaked out from wax. I want to gift them to family members embracing home school/ Covid that is starting in less than 2 weeks. Unfortunately, I can not give them out as gift bc of the mess and deformities."
5,2013-01-14,"I ordered 3 of these candles for gifts. They arrived quickly and everyone loved them.  The quality is 1st rate, just like buying them straight from a Yankee Candle store.  Arrived in perfect condition. They smell amazing and last a very long time."
4,2021-02-04,I used this for me to smell my apt up with this smell. I hardly smelled it. So then I ordered the citrus and sage. Not happy.Now I ordered lilacs . I hope I can smell this.
2,2020-02-28,"I’ve purchased this brand and scent of Yankee Candle, French Vanilla, many times and am disappointed that this one smells so faintly. Nobody likes to be overpowered by a scent but this one is barely distinguishable even with my nose almost in the wax. I’m not sure if this is a brand change or if this is an old candle but it isn’t what I am accustomed to or what I expected."
4,2020-02-16,Fast arrival.  Well packaged.  Smell good.
4,2020-01-30,I would have given 5 stars if it had been fresher!
1,2015-11-12,I am so disappointed with this candle - I let it burn for over an hour and no scent of pumpkin whatsoever. I stood right next to it - no scent at all - did I get a defective one with no oil??
3,2019-01-28,Hardly has any scent.
4,2020-05-03,"Candle does not smell like the orginal scent for Buttercream, he smells like Christmas Cookie"
4,2020-12-28,Liked the smell. Was a present for someone else.
1,2021-09-28,Wife ordered 2 of the pumpkin spice candles.  When we opened them the smell was strong.  Hit us right in the face like a Yankee Candle normally does.  That was the end of that.  As soon as we lit it there was no smell at all.  Was lit for hours and the house just smelled like burnt wax.  2 of these burning in the house at the same time would normally make every floor in the house smell good.  Nope not these.  Disappointed in them.  Will be returning.  Seems pretty common based on the reviews not sure how people lucked out with good smelling ones and others didn't.  Maybe they are hit or miss but usually everytime I've ever bought a Yankee Candle directly from the store itself the scent was always really strong when they were burning.
1,2018-11-20,"I, literally, NEVER write reviews...so this is a first. I was so excited to find a cinnamon candle. I had one from Gold Canyon Candles and it was the best I have ever found. Sadly, they quit making them. I bought this, hoping it would be close. Let me say...it is awful! I've had it burning for hours and can only smell it, if I walk close to it...then I can barely smell it.  I will never by another Yankee Candle."
2,2021-09-18,Smells like play dough. Bummer.
3,2022-01-24,Quite disappointed w/strength of scent.
2,2021-04-16,"Siempre aposté a esta marca de velas, tenían prefirió y su aroma estupendo. Todo se fue, el frasco abierto huele bien. Pero una vez encendida la vela, final del aroma.  Gran chasco. Pruebe otra marca"
4,2019-05-12,"Love the smell, but doesnt seem to smell-up the environment as yankees usually do"
3,2020-08-30,Scent isn't too strong but enough for a small room.
3,2021-12-23,Could not smell candle.  Wick off centered.
3,2021-02-14,"I don’t care for overly scented candles, but the Home Sweet Home candle that I received has no scent at all when burning.  If the candle is not lit and you sniff closely, there is a faint smell.  Very disappointing, especially for the cost."
1,2020-04-22,"I love, love, love a Yankee candle. I was soooo excited to get this scent bc it's literally my favorite. For some reason though this particular candle doesn't smell at all when it burns. You can smell it faintly when it's not burning, but I let it burn for over 2 hours and smelled nothing. I even asked my daughter and husband and even when you stand over top it, while burning....nothing. I've had many Yankee candles and even the mildly scented candles give off much more scent than this one. I'm thinking the candle is maybe just old, hence the price. So disappointing."
3,2022-06-18,I liked the smell but it’s really week. Not strong enough to cancel out smell of food
3,2020-06-26,I found the scent was very weak. Not what I expected from a candle this price.
4,2022-03-09,Smells too waxy?
5,2016-09-07,So happy to have pumpkin smells in my house again!
3,2021-11-23,I ordered like 5 candles at once and this was the only one that was like....leaking? It has this sticky goo around the top
3,2021-01-02,"I did not keep this candle, returned. It had a scent that I did not see myself using, did not think I would use so returned."
5,2015-10-30,Love the smell. I also love Luke
3,2021-06-29,I was disappointed in the scent of this candle as you can barely smell anything
4,2020-11-04,The scent wasn't very strong.
4,2019-12-15,Yankee candle burns much longer and cleaner
5,2019-07-17,Nice coconut scent
2,2022-02-23,The wick burned down to a point I could no longer light it. Must have been a faulty candle never had this problem with Yankee Candles before.
4,2019-09-10,Seems to burn faster then ones purchased from yankee candle.
1,2022-01-28,Candle was shipped on its side and melted. I called customer service to get it replaced and explained how it was shipped. They said they would notate it so it wouldn't happen again. Same thing the 2nd time. I even tried setting them in the sun to maybe melt it back but didn't work. Would not suggest unless shipping protocol has changed. Scent was good. Unfortunately that's all I can say about this item.
2,2021-07-16,"I grew up w Yankee Candles. I’ve always loved them, however I have not bought one in a few years. I ordered the Cupcake one and another scent during Prime Deals. I can barely smell either while they burn. I even burn them a few hours at a time. Disappointed."
5,2019-06-28,Love it!
4,2022-01-02,"Smells good, too small to use more than once."
4,2019-08-05,Good candle. Was much cheaper than getting it from yankee direct
3,2022-01-10,"Not a great candle....can only smell it if you're really close.  And no, I don't have covid!"
1,2021-03-07,"Should’ve listened to other reviews but I chose to give then a try bc we love this scent and couldn’t find a lot of alternatives especially not reasonably priced (if I recall correctly).  Arrived totally broken, couldn’t even unbox it due to amount of glass.  And of course we have forgotten to return it so will have to eat the cost.  Do yourself a favor and find a different seller because it’s clearly an issue on their end if this many people are bothering to inform others that it was broken via their review."
4,2018-12-25,I love everything about this candle except for the fact that it cannot burn down as far as most other similar problem due to the metal holding the wicks.
1,2021-12-09,"I used to absolutely love Yankee candles. But I've found that my recent purchases of their candles were very disappointing. ""Christmas Cookie"" was my favorite! I would get 10 of them every December.  But now every one  of them that I have purchased have no scent! What happened? I will stick with my favorite Homeworx candles  and the few Bath and Body candles ( Pumpkin Apple is my favorite. Very strong throw) for now."
4,2020-11-17,Good
2,2018-09-25,"I absolutely love Yankee Candles, especially this one (Vanilla Cupcake), but am so disappointed.  There is no smell.  I've been burning it for 2 days now and even my co-workers say they can't smell anything.  At least it was cheaper than going to Yankee and purchasing it there, but won't buy it again.  I gave it 2 starts for the price."
2,2017-07-27,"I purchased this candle because my friend had it and I really enjoyed the smell. However, I no longer like to burn this candle because I found out it is made using paraffin wax. Although the product description doesn't say what type of wax it is made from, which they should, a quick Google search states that Yankee candles are made using paraffin wax. Paraffin wax is made using ""petroleum, coal, or oil shale,"" yuck! So although I like the smell, I'd really rather not fill my lungs with the burning fumes from ""petroleum, coal, or oil shale"" products. I think Yankee should be more concerned with the quality of their product and how it can affect the health of people and the environment, and start using soy waxes. I found the info on paraffin wax from Wikipedia."
2,2021-11-10,It arrived melted but we’re able to use it. I should have known better than ordering a candle to me delivered in Arizona.
4,2022-04-07,"I liked that it burns evenly, no messy wax all over."
2,2021-12-16,"I have bought many Yankee candles but this one does not have much fragrance. Burns rather oddly, not long lasting."
2,2021-01-03,"Scent not to my liking - a sickly sweet kind of smell, like a bottle of maple syrup broke and spilled everywhere.Very strong smell, can be detected in multiple rooms.Perhaps others may like the scent, but it was too much for me."
3,2022-02-24,No smell
2,2020-02-28,"Once the candles arrived I removed the tops to smell if the scent was potent and the candles smelled rather strong so I was hopeful these weren't duds. Once lit, the candle produced little if any scent at all. The funny thing is, I ordered 2 of them (the same scent-Vanilla Cupcake) and neither one had much scent while burning. Pretty disappointing."
3,2022-04-17,Not happy at all. Yankee Candle has disappointed me. This candle had very little smell and didn't burn well at all.
2,2018-02-05,"Purchased this because I'v bought the Yankee Butter Cream brand in a larger size from a store.  And it smelled great.  Equally important, that large size from the store not only lasted a long time, but it filled two rooms with the warm, relaxing scent.  Not this thing.  For $20, I could buy two other  candles and liked them a lot more!"
2,2021-05-21,"Beautify jar and wax color but no smell.  What happened to Yankee Candles?  They used to smell great. Now, nearly nothing.  I'll be looking elsewhere for candles."
1,2020-01-12,"Hate it! Absolutely hate the smell. It smells like acrid, heavily burnt maple syrup. Not pleasant maple syrup but burnt in a bad way. There is also a weirdly spicy, musty undertone or quality to it that I can't quite explain. Whatever it is, the candle does NOT smell like creme brulée as someone else here claimed. Its cloying, heavily charred, burnt maple stench just sticks to the back of the throat like mad medicine.Plus, unlike some Yankee Candles, the stench is STRONG and lingers, so there is no escaping it before for quite a while afterwards. Even my poor dog's fur smelled of it for days. (Why are bad fragrances or aromas always the strongest or last forever?)Don't get me wrong, I like sweet, foody, gourmand-scented candles, but this one is dreadful. I should have bought Yankee Candle's Vanilla Cupcake again instead because that one is delicious, not obnoxiously cloying."
2,2021-06-14,"Straight out of the box, it didn't smell like chocolate cake in the slightest. Very artificial and barely resembled chocolate at all, smelled almost exactly like a Tootsie Roll. As candles usually smell exactly the same when lit, I didn't bother and didn't want to risk being unable to return it. Got a full refund so I added a star."
4,2019-08-16,"Compared to the brick and mortar store, this is a good buy."
4,2019-12-12,I unfortunately didnt notice the sent until the candle was halfway burnt down. It was still a great candle and burned for a very long time.
4,2021-02-23,I don’t smell anything lol
5,2018-02-02,"Excellent candle, excellent service, excellent price!"
1,2021-12-28,The usual Yankee scent is missing in a newly gifted candle.  Third one this season.  Something off abs it’s not Covid.
3,2022-04-16,Ok
3,2022-04-16,Ok
4,2014-03-01,"I purchased this for my granddaughter.  She had listed this along with other hints for her Christmas gifts. She seemed very happy to have gotten the Yankee Candle and stated it was her very favorite.  As always, grandmothers are pleased when her grandchild is excited about the she gave.  I believe anyone would enjoy this particular candle and would recommend it."
2,2021-12-15,I am very disappointed.  You can barely smell cinnamon and it smells like burning wax more than cinnamon.
3,2021-01-08,"Scent is lovely, but bad for large rooms/areas. Nice for small room/bathroom. Burns evenly. No issues besides faint scent."
4,2018-12-24,"As always, burns well if you keep wick trimmed.  Aroma is wonderful!  Cheaper than stores."
3,2020-10-04,"I bought half price on Amazon, this is my favorite scent. Candle had holes and air bubbles, clearly the reason for lower price."
5,2018-11-20,Love Yankee candle.
3,2021-10-25,I live in a very small one bedroom apartment and this candle was not noticeable at all.
4,2020-02-20,Long lasting but the sent could have been stronger
4,2021-10-18,I used it for my self to enjoy.
5,2018-02-09,Best candle smell ever!
2,2020-05-12,This is the first Yankee candle that I have ever purchased that appears counterfeit. The sent was weak and most significantly it burned like a cheap candle (burning in middle and leaving candle wax around the sides.  Very disappointed.
3,2020-10-20,"The scent of this candle is fantastic......i could smell it even before I opened the package.  That's because is leaked gooey oily gunk out of the cocked lid.  Not sure how that happened since it arrived in a Yankee box with the jar protective insert, however the box appeared to have been previously opened and retaped.  May have been someone else's return."
4,2019-01-28,The exchange process was simple but I got it exchanged. It is a quality candle like all Yankee Candle products.
1,2017-07-09,No  choco mint smell whatsoever ! Didnt expect this from  Yankee !  Score 0
3,2022-06-29,I liked the size and the two wicks but it didn't give off as much of a scent as it USED to! Yankee Candles were the best and filled the room with scent!
4,2021-12-20,"Candle smells good but arrived completely broken, glass pieces everywhere. Delivery drivers need to handle with care and not throw packages."
4,2018-10-03,Love it love chocolate but price outrageous so now I got my own supplys make my own for 20% cost
4,2022-02-21,Not sure it’s a real yankee candle. It doesn’t smell as strong like true yankee candle I’ve purchased from the yankee store.
4,2013-12-19,Love the smell! You can't always find this scent in stores. And this was cheaper than what I've found around town.
2,2022-02-20,The scent didn’t really come out while burningSoDisappointed
1,2015-11-21,This is the only YC scent I truly love.  Imagine my disappointment when the candle barely has any of the want-to-lick-it-because-it-smells-so-amazing aroma.
2,2021-12-11,Very little scent . The candle wax was in 3 or 4 layers rather than solid . I don’t know if Yankee sold them to Amazon just to get rid of a damaged product or if the separation of wax was actually due to improper storage .
4,2017-12-29,Yankee Candles are a good by and while the holidays are about over they will always brighten up your home. Ordered three of then
4,2020-02-14,👌🏻
1,2021-09-30,I wasn't sure I'd like this but it smells great! I've been burning it most evenings since I got it. Perfect fall scent. I'll definitely buy this one again.Update: In the process of buying 3 more every one that comes is smashed in its box.  Broken glass all over the place.  Yankee Candle packages them well so someone is really mistreating these boxes to have them all smashed up.
5,2017-10-06,I love these candles!
3,2020-06-29,"This candle smells too sugary. I was hoping for more of a caramel scent, but it just smells like I’m baking something with a lot of sugar in it."
1,2020-11-28,I was excited to get these candles at $11.99 but I see why they were so cheap now. I've always bought Yankee Candles but these aren't like any I have had in the past. There is no scent! You literally have to put your nose up to the candle while it's burning to smell anything. Usually Yankee Candles when burning will fill my entire home with the scent. I would not recommend these particular candles.
2,2022-03-27,I've always loved my yankee candles I'm a candle lover but for whatever reason this barely has a smell and nothing while it's burning very disappointed:(
1,2021-12-07,The candle smells nice but is no where near as nice as a real Yankee candle.  I think these are counterfeit - someone kept the jar and refilled it with a candle but it just is not as strong nor pleasant as a real Yankee candle.  I am disappointed.
4,2020-01-11,Burning uneven
5,2018-02-18,Very good deal
4,2019-11-17,Love this cinnamon candle
1,2021-11-18,"I'm a fan of Yankee Candle and have even visited their facility/headquarters. I've never purchased a candle from them and been disappointed . . . until this candle.  I ordered this and also a Crossroads Buttered Maple Syrup, for the Fall season.  We can barely smell anything from the Yankee Spiced Pumpkin.  For a similar seasonal scent, I'd recommend the Crossroads Buttered Maple Syrup. Great scent. Yankee needs to go back to the drawing board on the Spiced Pumpkin."
2,2020-08-07,"I love caramel, but this stuff is a bootleg caramel. I was so excited to receive it, but then the scent hit me with the unpleasant burnt fake caramel and my day was ruined🤙🏻 Still love Yankee Candle tho."
2,2021-02-28,"Yankee candles are one of my favorite brands. However, my experience with is purchase is less than favorable. The scent is very weak. This is the first time purchasing a candle where you cannot smell the fragrance. Very disappointed, possibly an old candle or not a true Yankee candle."
1,2018-10-18,"This candle, while it smells great on cold sniff, once burning, it has no scent throw whatsoever. Sadly, I find this to be true all too often with most Yankee Candles. I am not sure what happened to Yankee, because one of their candles used to have the ability to permeate my entire apartment, easily. That just isn't the case with this candle. I can only smell it when and if I put my face directly over it, and even then it isn't a strong scent. It definitely isn't worth the $25 price tag. I wouldn't buy this one again. Very disappointed."
4,2020-01-18,It was a gift
3,2022-01-25,Good as all YC but not the best smell
3,2021-07-23,"Well it does smell like vanilla, however not as pungent as the half used holiday Xmas cookie candle I found at a thrift store. I was disappointed as I loved that candle I found. The sent seems muted. However, the burn life on this candle seems pretty fair."
4,2015-03-26,"This thing is great -- it makes the place smell like fresh-baked cookies. I only wish the jar were not branded and a bit nicer, aesthetically. It's a high quality jar though, as most people know."
4,2020-10-03,"This candle smells great however it looks like it melted during shipping. The box, cardboard surrounding candle and lid had melted wax/oil. It’s odd cause it’s cold in WI now!"
3,2021-03-21,Not as strong smelling as I would've liked. I was a bit disappointed.
2,2018-05-03,Disappointed in this candle Not much of a scent at all It did burn evenly
3,2020-05-24,"This candle wick smokes a lot. If you buy this candle, you will have to keep cutting the wick. The wick remains long after using this candle. The smell of this candle is not strong."
3,2018-09-07,"Arrived shattered. Amazon replaced with no hassle, but made me mail back broken glass. Didn’t seem very prudent. But a lovely smelling candle and the new one arrived in perfect condition and quickly."
2,2020-09-29,"Scentless, every yankee candle sold on amazon has been brand new but does not give off any scent at all! Waste of money..Ive tried so many, haven’t had any luck through amazon. Disappointing."
1,2022-07-09,As you can see this is NOT giftable. I’m trying to find it by digging my scissors through. Love the scent though. It came in on time! Now I see why the discounted this item. I ordered the last two but the other one has not come in yet so I’m hoping it doesn’t come damaged as well. Both have no wick Horrible !
2,2021-07-18,"The only issues l had with this was l ordered three and two came broken due to poor wrapping and there were only three available for purchase, it also looked as though they had been in the heat for awhile. The smell was great as usual for yankee candles."
2,2022-01-28,Something has changed with how they make this. Left it on in a 10x13 room with the door closed for at least 2 hours and it was barely noticeable after all that time. Not getting again.
2,2019-08-19,"I am a Bath and Body Works girl and buy all of my candles from them.But since I have had Yankee candles before, I thought I was getting a great bargain on this candle during Amazon Prime Days. Boy was I wrong. No throw at all with this candle. Very, very disappointed."
4,2021-03-28,"I love yankee candles but this specific one doesn't seem to burn as easily. When the wick burnt through, there was still wax along the sides of the candle."
2,2020-12-02,"This candle is pretty and smells good when it’s 2cm away from your nose but even after burning it ALL DAY, no scent comes off of it. Probably why it was on sale for $8"
3,2020-10-09,A very weak scent ...some may love it but I like a candle I can smell thru my home and when I enter a room... this doesnt do that
3,2022-03-08,Loved the candle because it was on sale but unfortunately it melted and all of the oils poured out of the candle and onto the cardboard box. Not sure how it’s supposed to smell due to this
4,2020-01-11,Smells great and burns well.
1,2021-12-06,"It's been burning now for about two hours and I still don't get cinnamon wafting through the house. It smelled really good when I first opened it, but unless you are right over the candle, you wouldn't know it's burning. Big disappointment. I imagine the longevity is the same as the other Yankee candles; however, I do not recommend buying it since the scent is so weak."
5,2016-12-16,Fills my room with the aroma of peach cobbler!
5,2016-01-11,"Love the smell of this candle...warm, cozy feeling"
2,2022-01-02,Disappointed in the smell. Very little to none when burning. Has better smell cold throw.
4,2021-09-16,Really enjoy the odor it puts off in room
3,2021-11-19,These do not seem as fragrant as the ones I buy in the store
4,2018-03-23,"Nice scent, but  pretty weak. Yankee needs to kick up the notch on the fragrance like back in the old days!"
4,2017-01-28,"Love the fragrance.  Reminds me of the holidays.  I have this and a pine/balsam one which I keep burning, nearly all the time, during the holiday season."
2,2021-08-22,The vanilla has very little scent. Disappointed in the vanilla. However other fragrances are very nice.
1,2021-09-21,"The candle has no scent after the first burn. The first burn was amazing and smelled so good, and it was so disappointing to relight and smell absolutely nothing. Halfway through the candle now after many burns and there is no scent as all."
5,2015-11-09,Once of my favorite and you cant always find this in the store.
2,2019-03-12,Has no real smell
4,2020-01-02,"Lovely candle, love yankee"
2,2020-02-03,"Somewhat disappointed. Yankee candes typically have a nice strong scent that fills ones house and I've had this Spiced Pumpkin candle scent before. However, this candle isn't very strong even after burning all day.Disappointed."
4,2021-05-12,"Scent was great! Size was much smaller then the larger versions, but worth cost."
4,2019-07-31,wish it were a little stronger
4,2019-11-24,nice scent
4,2019-04-04,Lasts a long time and fills the room with vanilla
1,2020-11-06,This candle has no scent. I kept wondering for two days why My eyes were burning.  I realized that it was the candle.I am shocked that yankee candle would put out such a Piece of junk. I paid good money for it and it is in the garbage
3,2020-08-31,Ordered two candles.  One arrived like this.  With covid not going to ups store to return. Not happy and I picked it up from outside one minute after arrival.
3,2021-11-24,The jar was chipped on the rim so had to be careful while using.
3,2020-11-28,"It smells like cinnamon-flavored candy. Like big red chewing gum or fireballs or red hots.Unfortunately, I hate those candies."
2,2019-11-05,"NO TO VERY FAINT SCENT!!.. Yankee by far one of my favorite candle brands go with them 90% of the time. If I go to the store at the mall and buy one I have NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED. I couldn't make it out so I ordered this one off Amazon (where I do alot of my shopping) and I am so upset and disappointed with this Candle it has NO SCENT....It will be burning for 2 hours as I might get a faint whiff...Home Sweet Home, classic yankee, have bought this scent for 5 plus years now."
4,2015-01-01,"Gifted to my young adult daughter for Christmas. She loves it, but personally, I don't smell much scent when lit and I found it costly. I found cheaper versions that smell a lot stronger."
1,2018-02-04,"Throw is about a 7/10, but it doesn’t smell like “bakery air”, it actually smells like pecans. Just bitter pecans. Burns evenly. Got it on sale for $9, wouldn’t pay more than that for a candle this size (medium pillar)."
2,2022-05-24,Way to smoky …. I’m gagging from it still
5,2016-01-31,Gave this to my daughter as  gift. She loves ves the scent. She burns the candle daily.What a great candle!
3,2021-01-05,The candle was very nice looking; but for the priece  it burns away too fast.
5,2016-12-27,"Heavy on sugar and butter, but light on peach. It's a tempting and delicious smell, but it disappointing that it wasn't more peachy, as that was the scent that made  me buy it."
3,2021-03-19,Was very disappointed for a Yankee candle... Burnt awful
1,2020-12-15,"Wasted my money :( can’t smell a thing. Yankee used to have amazing candles, not anymore. I wanted my house to smell like Christmas. I bought this one and two Christmas cookie ones and they were all disappointing . I should’ve figured why they lowered the price . Extemly disappointed, I should have spent that on Christmas presents :("
2,2021-09-09,I used to buy this brand and scent all the time.  1 candle would make my entire downstairs smell amazing.  They have gotten cheap with the oils.  I was burning 3-4 in my downstairs and the house barely had any scent.  Target or Bath and Body have stronger candles
2,2021-03-28,The candle was melted and I couldn’t get to the wick. Had to put it on top of the stove and turned on the oven to try to melt the candle so I could get to the wick.  The scent was not buttercream. I’ve purchaseda lot  Yankee buttercream candles and never did they smell like this. I was very disappointed in it.
3,2020-11-11,"siempre compro velas con aroma de vainilla, pero está no huele a nada, no vuelvo a comprarla"
2,2015-05-12,Love it. Slightly melted when I received it though. Which was disappointing 😔
5,2017-01-09,You can't go wrong with a Yankee Candle!
1,2021-12-23,These are on sale for a reason. They were obviously stored upside down all summer in a hot warehouse. Now all the wax is melted into the lid. No wick to be seen. A useless paperweight. I've bought candles from Amazon dozens of times. This is the first I've seen anything like this. Disappointing & a hassle to exchange. Don't waste your money.
3,2021-11-06,Scent too faint.
1,2021-02-12,Using this candle made me sick. It has some sort of toxic irritant in it. Within a day of burning it my sinuses were clogged & I started becoming sick. This was not normal. After airing out the house and recovering I tried the candle again and realized it was the source of the issue as I started becoming sick again.
3,2018-12-12,"I wanted to like this candle, price was good, but lacked smell, very weak for a top brand like Yankee candle. Also, not burning even, was looks clumped up, wick almost goes out of burned awhile. Disappointed."
3,2020-10-07,"Overall the package was great.  The candle was safe for shipping.  But, the scent was not strong."
4,2018-11-27,"Great fragrance, I just wish the throw was a little stronger."
4,2019-12-31,"Great candle light flame, but wish there was more cinnamon sent"
3,2017-12-16,I always hate it when you notice a product cheapen over time to cut costs or to fatten a companies wallet. The glass on this product is really thin now and the seal isn’t much on it . It would be to easy to accidentally break it and cause possible issues.
3,2020-08-16,This candle seems to be old as the scent 'throw' is lacking. A former favorite. You will be disappointed.
4,2017-05-08,"So. As soon as I opened the box I was hit with the aroma of chocolate! To me and my husband it smelt alot more like a tootsie roll rather than chocolate cake. So I had mixed feelings on that but for some reason, once it got to the middle of the candle it started smelling like cake. If you are looking for a strong candle, THIS IS IT! Before i even lit it, our room was filled with it (we have quite a large room btw) and once it was lit, we could smell it as soon as we got in the house. Mind you our room is all the way upstairs and on the oposite side than the front door. I give it 4 stars cause it was a little too over powering at times (super super sweet) and it smelt more like a tootsie roll rather than cake half the time."
4,2011-12-30,"Love yankee candles. They burn long and even. The scent of Vanilla cupcake is a little strong, I prefer just the regular vanilla. Some of Yankee's candle scents are a bit strong. I stick with the cleaner ones."
5,2015-12-02,"Great product, great smell."
3,2021-12-29,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 I like how long these candles burn for and the scent is great. I am giving 3 stars because my jar came broken. I am reaching out to support and so will update my review accordingly."
3,2019-11-07,The scent is nice but not very strong. I have purchased this brand and this same scent many times before but this candle is not as fragrant as in the past
2,2019-03-02,I've never owned a Yankee candle that smelled so weak. I purchased 2 and both had a very faint scent
1,2020-01-05,"We ordered 2 of the chocolate cake scented candles based on the one I already purchased from the Yankee Candle store. These were nothing like the one I already have. I could smell them before I even opened the box they were shipped in, where they were then in another box and in protective shipping cardboard with the lids on them in that 2nd box. Once opened the smell went throughout the house and was stuck to everything the candles touched (hands, clothes, counter top). I put them and the boxes in the garage after I got a severe headache (within 60 minutes) and returned them to a Kohl’s drop off center soon after. While in line the associate asked me what I had that smelled so strong and I felt bad leaving them with her to deal with, but I happily did."
1,2017-05-20,"Glass was broken , very disappointed"
2,2021-11-09,"The scent is wonderful but the candle doesn't burn well with one wick. For the size of the jar, there should be 2 wicks. With only 1 wick, it doesn't burn the candle wax on the sides of the jar. The 2 wick Yankee candles are much better."
1,2021-11-09,Weak scent and doesn't burn evenly. These are not the same candles they once were. Yankee used to be the best and I loved them but not anymore. Disappointing purchase.  Homeworx candles are WAY better (on qvc)
5,2018-04-06,Arrived quick and item is as expected.
1,2021-11-27,"This is absolutely the last time I will buy a Yankee Candle Sparkling Cinnamon candle. I am appalled at the lack of scent this thing puts out. The candle smells so nice when it's unlit. But, as soon as you start burning it, it produces virtually no scent whatsoever. My Bath & Body Works cinnamon-scented candle fills the room with scent. I'll stick with them from here on out. I wish I could return this pathetic candle."
4,2019-01-18,Burned immediately.  Daughter loves this scent.
1,2019-11-02,I have bee purchasing Yankee Candles for about 20 years - they are not what they used to be.  The only time I can smell the scent is if I put the candle right up to my nose.  I have it right now sitting on the end table just under 2 feet from me and I cannot smell it.  I remember how they used to be so filled with scent that you could smell it all through the house.  I used to justify the expense of these candles by the quality.  Not anymore.
5,2018-10-29,Great scent and long lasting
1,2021-12-11,The ad for this candle promises a soft ivory colored candle scented like vanilla cupcake. The candle I received is a bright yellow and has no aroma at all. It also is rattling around in the jar leading me to believe it’s been sitting around the warehouse past its prime. Super disappointed in Amazon’s lack of quality control on this one.
2,2020-12-01,Burns very dirty- cutting the wick does not help keep the flame down. The whole jar turned black. I will not purchase again. Disappointed that I bought more than 1 at this time. I would not even gift them.
4,2017-10-15,"Strong, accurate vanilla scent. Pricey, but for scent lovers, this company has very good products."
1,2020-10-15,"I read reviews that said this had a very weak scent, but I gave it a shot anyway. First, it arrived in a Yankee Candle branded box, as if it was shipped directly from the source, and it was packaged well. Although when I took the top off, there were weird bubbles on the top of the candle that deprecated when I touched them...weird! I was just in a full price Yankee Candle store yesterday and it appeared to be the same candle (I shouldn’t have hesitated and just bought it directly from the store). I lit the candle and went into another room to test it out. I waited to see if the fragrance would carry over to the room I was in, because that’s what happens with my other Yankee Candles. I checked periodically and there was zero scent. The only time I smelled anything at all was if I stood directed over the candle and put my face close to the top. This is ridiculous. I think this is an OLD candle. Just like perfume, I think candles can lose their potency. Don’t waste your money!"
1,2022-04-19,"had zero scent.  its been quite a while since I used Yankee brand.  ive been a fan of bath and body for a while now.  has yankee gone down hill or what!?  this candle had no scent!  I thought vanilla was one that you cant mess up lolglad they give refunds, im taking my $20 to bath and body :D"
4,2022-02-18,The smell is really good and the candle lasts for a long time
3,2021-05-09,Scent didn't last long. Almost as if they only scented the top inch. Very dissapointed!
4,2018-10-27,Stopped burning when wax started getting low. Too expensive
5,2017-01-31,Can never go wrong with a Yankee Candle
4,2019-01-27,This was a gift and my sister loved it!!
1,2017-10-27,Pumpkin spice has always been my favorite scent.  This candle has zero scent! I had a social gathering at my home and several guests commented how they couldn't smell any throw.  I don't know if the candle is old or what - but very disappointing.  I wish I would have driven the hour to an actual Yankee Candle store than to have wasted my money on this candle.
1,2015-06-07,After only 3 burns this candle was defective. With a gaping 3 inch drop from the wick -- no wax! What a waste of money.
3,2021-01-03,Ok I love Yankee Candle but this one smelled awful!
2,2019-04-09,"This one didn't have the typically robust Yankee Candle smell, so I returned it.  I do believe it could've just been an old candle because I bought this at Bed Bath and it was great.  So I like the scent, but may be better to test drive the scnet n the store."
2,2021-07-29,"This is a nicely scented candle, but it's not very strong and it burns pretty quick."
3,2022-02-03,Create tunnel burning. Constantly have to adjust to burn evenly.
4,2022-04-10,It smells like cakes i could eat it easily hahaha
3,2020-01-08,"The scent was great.  But it burned horribly.  Kept burning around the wick, but not the sides.  I have to keep pushing the sides down. :("
1,2022-01-03,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 I can’t really smell anything and when u come up close on the candle the vanilla is chemical smelling I would of been better off buying another salted caramel candle that 1 and the vanilla cupcake when u light them it goes through the whole room but not this French vanilla candle"
4,2016-02-04,Love the candles!  I ordered five as gifts.  One was broken on arrival.  They appeared to be well packed.  The cause of the breakage was not clear.
4,2020-07-14,Good candle for the reduced price. I'm happy 😊
5,2013-03-07,my mom loved this gift as she is a candle freak.  She loves homeade pumpkin pie so you I couldn't go wrong.
3,2019-11-17,"Absolutely the best chocolate scent of any chocolate candle I have! If you are a chocolate lover as I am, you will just love this candle!"
1,2020-08-23,"NOT an authentic Yankee candle not even close, burning in a small room for almost 3 hours now and can barely smell it. Sad that amazon keeps letting sellers rip buyers off with replica products. A true Yankee candle burning for 3 hours would over power a large house, with which ever scent is burning. This candle is 5 feet from me and I smell nothing. Got up left the room came back in a few times and could barely smell it when i re entered. Its what i get for trying to save $10 bucks. Ill be ordering directly from Yankee from now on."
3,2019-10-08,We were so disappointed in this. The scent was gone after the first quarter of the candle was melted. I expected better quality from this brand.
1,2022-03-11,"So sad they changed ingredients for their candles.  I used to love smelling the beautiful fragrances throughout the house.  Now you are lucky you can smell anything when you take the cap off.  Whole heartedly miss the ""old"" Yankee candles.  I would definitely pay the extra dollar and know that I could enjoy the scents for several days.  I will no longer buy this product."
1,2020-08-21,"I thought this price was too good to be true, and I wish I'd stuck with my initial suspicions. The Cupcake candle I bought has zero scent throw. Even when it's right under your nose, there's no scent. I'm really irritated and will just keep this in the cabinet to use as light when a storm knocks our power out because there's no scent benefit at all."
3,2019-12-16,The candle was beautiful but I was very disappointed in the scent wish it had been stronger like there other candles I have bought.
3,2017-06-20,"It smells fantastic but they need to bubble-wrap the top separately or bind it closed better. It arrived shattered, because I guess the top must have shifted and banged against the glass container. Not fun opening a package with a bunch of broken glass :("
1,2020-09-25,"I was truly hoping for Yankee candle quality. Not even halfway down through the candle the wicked disappeared. Generally, when you light a Yankee candle, it will easily, leave it’s more than aromatic scent. My downstairs is more than 1200 ft.², the whole first floor, attic, and the stairs going down to the basement are always inundated with the delightful smell. Sadly, it did not encompass this area in the least. It barely scented my 14x14 kitchen."
1,2021-10-10,"I don't know if what I got was fake but I was never this disappointed by a Yankee candle. The pumpkin spice candle smelled like burning wax, no scent at all. I wonder if I was sent a fake... Never spending the money on them again, now they are expensive for no reason."
3,2018-11-12,"Usually Yankee candles are quite strong, this one does not seem to be like the others I have bought elsewhere. It's ok but not great."
4,2019-04-12,Love the scent
2,2022-03-13,Not a true chocolate smell.
3,2019-01-13,I usually love Yankee Candles but this one has a problem. The wicks are very short and difficult to light and keep lit. The wax covers them quickly and the scent is very subtle very very subtle!
1,2021-11-30,I usually buy these more expensive Yankee candles because their smells are strong and can fill up my living room. This one and another I bought on here have absolutely no smell. You would have to literally put your face next to the candle to smell it and even then it's faint. Extremely disappointed and will not be buying again.
1,2021-06-22,"Because of the Yankee Candle brand name I was expecting a quality candle.  Sadly there was very little fragrance to fill one room, let alone the entire house.  I have a one-floor cottage.  Next time, I will purchase a Yankee Candle through their store."
1,2020-12-26,"One of the other reviewers said that Yankee candles are HIT or MISS with scent.  I have to agree.  Bought 2..Autumn Wreath and French Vanilla.  Autumn, strong scent.. only burn for a couple of hours a the house smelled great...HIT.  French Vanilla..NO scent.  Standing right over the candle and nothing...MISS."
2,2020-01-20,"I love yankee candles, they’re all I’ve ever used however this home sweet home does not smell at all, super disappointed"
3,2022-01-02,The scent wasn’t there. Very disappointed! I have bought Yankee candles for many years and loved the scents. I have not had COVID so it has nothing to do with my smell.
1,2017-01-28,Emits no scent
3,2022-05-26,Just an okay scent.  Prefer others.
4,2019-03-19,Burns even good odor
3,2021-12-18,Love the fragrance of this candle and the longevity of it lasting..will buy more
3,2015-05-06,"On at least 4 separate dates in 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2013 in NYC we experienced what became known as Maple Syrup Events when the air around the city smelled like maple syrup. Nobody knew why. Some people were happy about and some were not happy about it. I was one of the people not happy about it. Not because I thought it was a terrorist attack but because I just do not really love the odor of maple syrup.This candle smells like maple syrup. Sticky, sugary, overpoweringly sweet. May be nice to eat. Wouldn't want to roll in it.NY Times reports the odor came from a factory in NJ making fragrances out of the seeds of fenugreek."
5,2017-05-23,Nothing like peach for my but VERY pleasent.
1,2021-09-14,Love Yankee candles but this was the very first I have purchased that had absolutely NO SCENT!  It’s still a pretty candle but without the scent……so disappointing.What happened Yankee Candles?
2,2022-04-23,It had no scent
4,2018-12-02,Scent not as strong as I would like
5,2016-10-10,Lovely strong scent although it did arrive with oils leaked.
5,2015-01-29,Best smell ever and actually smells your whole house!
4,2019-02-27,Decent scent
2,2020-11-29,"The product itself is great, however it arrived glass shattered around the rim. Tried to use it, but it's not the same effect."
5,2013-12-30,"I enjoy Yankee candles.  I have never had any problems with a Yankee candle.  The price is not bad, and it was well packaged.  No problems here."
4,2015-05-11,This scent is cozy and inviting.
4,2018-04-02,Exactly as Advertised.  Super Fast Shipping.  Very Happy A++
4,2020-01-04,Smells great
3,2018-12-10,As a Yankee Candle junkie I was thrilled to find them here. BUT I had ordered the 2 wick pillar candles not the jars which is what I got. I figured they were out of pillars.... They're still offering them so not sure where the problem is. Had the same thing happen on a separate order
1,2020-10-11,i heard nothing but good things about Yankee candles so decided to try it myself. This french vanilla scent candle absolutely has no smell. It will burn all day in my room and not even the slightest smell. I won’t be buying this brand again. I tried glade candles and they will smell all rooms in my house with no problem.
2,2022-03-13,PROB OLD NO SCENT
1,2020-05-11,I'm so sad.  In February I ordered 4 of the Salted Caramel candies intending on giving out 3 as gifts and burning one myself.  It emits absolutely no scent! I would be embarrassed to give the other 3 as gifts.  I am stuck with 4 scentless candles. Definitely not like any other Yankee candles I've had before! I'd rate it zero stars if that was possible
2,2021-07-28,Smells just like a tootsie roll. I lit it once and will not light it again.
3,2020-10-09,"Everyone's sense of smell is different, but I found this one to be a little overwhelming. It smells nice, but it's strong. I can only burn it for a little while before having to put it out."
4,2016-11-30,"Smell is great, well wrapped, but the red color leaked out.  Got it all over my hands when undoing the packaging."
2,2015-08-15,scent is not strong at all .... candle is lit next to me now & I can't smell it .... sad because Peach is my favorite
1,2021-09-10,C’mon!! This had to be store someplace hot. Back it goes
3,2017-12-01,Not strong at all. Good scent just not strong enough for a Yankee candle. It appears their scents are lacking in strength quality these days in a few I have tried. Loved the scent but want to smell it across the room.
4,2019-02-06,Great gift
3,2022-06-29,"Tiene un excelente tamaño, de verdad muy muy grande a buen precio. Pero la vela no tiene aroma no huele a nada eso es lo más triste 🥺"
5,2018-02-01,Awesome smell and burned for hours.
4,2021-07-15,home use...love it
2,2022-07-16,I honestly can't believe I spent almost $30 for this garbage. No smell at all of chocolate. What a waste of money!! Please save yours and don't buy it! Too expensive and no scent at all!
4,2019-04-26,I had this delivered to my friend but it was cracked when it got there but he said it smells lovely 😊
2,2021-12-29,Very dissapointed...no scent.
5,2018-03-04,Excellent....as described!
4,2019-08-09,Smells like maple syrup n pancakes
3,2021-01-08,Not enough smell scent
2,2019-11-18,"Smells amazing- when not lit. Then when you light it, it’s very hard to smell it, even when standing right next to it."
4,2019-01-05,The scent is wonderful
4,2020-12-20,It's very nice and makes the house smell great 😊
2,2021-07-21,Did not burn even and you waste a lot of the candle because the wick burns and doesn't melt the wax evenly
3,2012-02-19,"My sisters are crazy about  Buttercream from Yankee Candle.  They went on and on about how good it smelled.  I bought it and ...  if you stand over the flame ... you can smell it.  It is a very nice aroma but ... it doesn't' get around a lot.  I'd like to send it back, but I've been burning it in the hopes that one day it will HIT!"
3,2018-01-14,Smells great but isn’t that strong and doesn’t have anaw some throw. I’ll be still cool by tobthe Apple pumpkin Friday m now on
4,2018-08-21,"Smells great, nice large jar"
3,2019-09-29,Candle smells amazing with your nose up to it... But once burning it doesn't seem to permeate the whole house like my candle directly from Yankee did.
4,2018-08-24,Best sent yet! Wish it was a bit stronger like some of their other scents.
3,2021-01-13,Love this candle!! However I can’t use it because the candle jar was shattered and there was glass all over when I opened it. It’s a shame because this is one of my favorite scents!
4,2018-12-20,Love the smell!
3,2020-12-02,Not very strong and the wicks don’t stay lit.
3,2020-05-15,Smells good but it would be weeks faster to just get one at the local store
4,2017-01-11,I like the price but I did not feel the scent was strong enough and that was what I really was looking for
2,2020-02-04,"Received the candle today. Had no idea I had ordered a used candle! The wick had been lit and burned some. Ordered two other scents, they arrived unused. Still disappointed though."
4,2017-03-29,"Love this scent, and Yankee candles burn evenly.  They are well worth the cost."
4,2018-01-31,I gave this as a Christmas gift. She liked it.
2,2021-11-10,I was disappointed in the fragrance and longevity. I've bought Yankee candles before and they were much more fragrant and lasted longer than this candle. I will not repurchase.
2,2021-11-28,Nice looking candle with light smell until it's lit.
4,2018-12-23,Smells good
5,2015-07-17,"This is a very pleasant scent in the usual, quality jar from Yankee Candle.  I will likely order more."
2,2020-11-19,"1st off love yankee candles, the flavor sounds appetizing as well. Part of the scent is good, but I feel the salted part irritates my nose, a burning sensation"
4,2020-01-02,Smell not strong enough
3,2019-12-17,Did not burn well as prior candles have. Problems with the wick. Decided to keep it anyway.
5,2012-03-12,"This candle smells delicious! It's an autumn scent, but I'll be burning it all year long. Burns well and lasts a very long time."
2,2020-05-17,The one candle was fine but the other melted and I can see a wick.  It should paribavky be packed right side up.  It was laying down in the box and that’s the way it melted too!
1,2022-02-12,"I recently started burning candles and love the way they make my home smell, but after burning my first Yankee Candles, I'm very disappointed. They give off practically no scent at all. While I'm sure they are happy to have omicron to blame with recent complaints of poor quality (which began well before the pandemic ever hit), but I'm fully vaccinated, always wear masks and can smell my other brands of candles just fine right now. This is absolute garbage for the price. I do not recommend."
2,2017-10-20,"This two star is only for the dud of a candle that I received, usually I adore all candles by Yankee. So I purchased the Spiced Pumpkin hoping that it would be just as fragrant as all of the others but unfortunately there is just no scent being dispersed; keep in mind it’s being used in a medium sized room with the door closed & there’s still no scent! I’m bummed because I really love the Apple Pumpkin and Apple Cider candles but this one left me feeling as though I threw $20 out the window."
3,2019-11-05,Barely able to notice the scent. It is expensive because it has Yankee on it. My Big Lots candle smells much better.
1,2021-12-23,"These candles (I would assume all under the brand name of Yankee Candle) have far too much soot and debris while burning.  For the price; unacceptable.  Potentially an airborne contaminant.  Recommend consumers look for a product with less smoke, soot and debris."
2,2020-02-18,"Smell is very light. And do not like the way it burns. And I cut my wick always before I relight them. I just can’t seem to smell this, Spiced Pumpkin, that much"
3,2017-12-22,"It seems to be a favorite of many people, but not mine. You can smell the apple, but I didn't quite like the pumpkin scent, which I normally love like Spiced Pumpkin. I couldn't smell any ginger or clove more apple and pumpkin."
1,2021-08-03,didnt like ! the chocolate smell was not that strong of a scent
2,2020-11-13,It's a pretty candle and the longevity is normal. The problem is that there is almost no scent when it's burning.
3,2021-02-24,Percent doesn’t last long very disappointing
3,2019-06-13,The candle is very attractive but the scent was so light as to be almost unnoticeable so I wouldn't buy more of these.
2,2013-09-13,I LOVE yankee candles and have never been disappointed with one until now. When I received this candle it was very greasy to the touch and when lit I could not smell it at all. Since I have never had this problem with their candles I am assuming that due to shipping some oils from the candle leaked out and caused it not to smell when lit. I think from now on I will buy these in person.
2,2019-02-03,"The price was great but it is obviously an old candle. As a former Yankee candle worker, I am very aware of how strong and how quickly the scent should fill the home. The scent is mild, at best and clearly this was an old candle. It is enough to lightly scent a bathroom with a few hours of burning. I am disappointed."
3,2017-09-14,"I love Yankee Candles but this candle really does not have a strong scent to it. Almost like nothing is going at all. I would probably not order this scent again through this company. By the way I love this scent normally but you just can't smell anything, might have just been a bad batch. Who knows."
3,2017-11-06,"This is a very light scent. Some people may prefer a light scent, but I prefer that this would be stronger so that it would make my living room smell nice. It might be stronger if I had it in a smaller room, but it is not strong enough for the open, main part of the house."
3,2019-12-17,A nice candle and a good price however the sent was not any good maybe that’s why it was discounted you could hardest smell it
1,2016-12-08,Didn't smell
4,2018-07-25,"OMG , love love love !!!"
2,2021-11-02,no fragrance
3,2019-01-21,"Got one of these as a Christmas gift, loved the fragrance, nice and strong.  But, these 2 I bought have nowhere near the  fragrance coming out."
1,2020-12-26,This is my least favorite of all the YC candles. You can't smell anything within the first 30 minutes; after that it just smells like a burning candle. I would not recommend. I'm going with my normal smells next time. Don't get me wrong I still love YC candles but I'm also trying to go towards SOY candles to help with in home toxins and help out my air filter.
2,2014-09-30,"For the price, I have regrets purchasing this candle. It does smell good in your face but emits a very week smell even after burning for several hours. Other Yankee candles put off great smell far and wide, this one not at all. Also, when burning, it smells as much of just plain burning wax than pumpkin spice. As an aside, horribly packed. I'm surprised it survived the trip."
4,2022-01-09,Awesome
4,2018-09-05,"I prefer the Coconut but this is a very good, long burning and clean burning candle."
2,2021-12-20,Was a gift and they loved it
3,2021-01-17,Not that much of a lasting smell.
4,2020-02-03,The scent is very light.
1,2020-05-04,I purchased this Yankee Sparkling Cinnamon Candle from Amazon and literally let it burn for 8 hours and there was absolutely ’NO’ scent at all!  I had previously purchased a Sparkling Cinnamon Candle from an actual Yankee Candle Store at our local Mall.  It was rich with cinnamon scent. I’ve been told before there are cheaper versions and to only buy from the store... now I believe it!
4,2017-10-26,Great deal but could have a little more fragrance
3,2020-05-10,"Love the longevity, wick works great to burn for long periods.  The scent is very mild and doesn't last long."
2,2020-11-04,This candle smells great up close unlit but I can barely smell it once it’s lit. I don’t know if maybe it’s just sat on the shelf too long but I’m disappointed. I expected more from Yankee Candle.
3,2021-02-10,Not as fragrant as I thought it would be...
2,2021-01-13,It doesn't put out as much aroma as my previous candle. I'll keep looking.
3,2019-12-15,Don’t buy.  Doesn’t smell
4,2021-01-04,Love the smell!
2,2021-12-28,No scent
5,2017-03-15,"I really like Black coconut, by Yankee Candle, but it appears that this is not made anymore. But I tried this one, and its nice."
1,2020-11-09,Horrible scent....way too powerful and the odor itself leaves me feeling nauseated. Too expensive to throw out so I’ll probably just leave it in the garage and light up there on occasion. Single worst Yankee candle I’ve ever had and I do enjoy most of them.
2,2020-10-02,"This candle lasted half as long as the large jar types, and the scent doesn't travel very far."
3,2019-07-05,"Just ok for ambience lighting, but not much fragrance."
4,2013-11-21,"Great Scent not over whelming. This is a great scent for anyone, its really mild and not flowery. I'm a guy and I love it."
3,2020-10-26,Scent does not last long
2,2022-05-04,Scent is good etc. but didn't have the glass jar because it arrive broken to pieces.  I had to place in on a candle stand.
2,2021-09-23,Really a bad candle due to arriving melted. No smell and the wicks could hardly light. Disappointing I am afraid.
2,2020-05-09,I am not convinced that this is an actual yankee candle product. The glass jar is different and thinner than your typical yankee candle and the wax has a lot of bubbles in it. I believe this product is either a fraud or defective.
1,2015-09-07,"Candle has a very ""off"" smell. Yankee is the best, but this scent is awefull."
1,2020-11-05,This is NOT A YANKEE CANDLE!!!  It’s a rip off I have had several Yankee candles they all smell wonderful this literally has no smell very disappointed!!👎👎👎
1,2021-10-22,"Never had an issue with Yankee Candle before so I'm very disappointed. No scent. Can only smell it in Jar or if you're immediately next to it and even then it's very, very faint. definitely doesn't fill the air. Thinking the candle wasn't pored / manufactured correctly- I've let it burn to 1/3 of the jar- still nothing. Waste of money."
2,2020-12-18,"Very little fragrance, candle burned uneven and wasn't worth the money."
1,2020-10-05,I am so Disappointed. I read several of the reviews that said that this Yankee pumpkin spice candle had very little scent but others  were very positive so I decided to go ahead and purchase it. Well I’m here to tell you there is NO SCENT WHATSOEVER! It’s been a number of years since I bought a Yankee candle as I had become disillusioned with less and less scent that they gave off but this is the worst ever. Grateful that I didn’t pay full price for this although it’s a total waste of money for me. Never again.
4,2012-11-08,This candle has a nice sweet smell. It reminds me of a cake baking or sugar cookies. Great choice and will definitely buy this again
2,2021-12-27,I think quality is not the same yet prices still high.
2,2021-10-08,i used to only buy yankee candles-but last 2 times the scent was not very strong. i will buy different brand next time.
3,2019-04-06,Don’t feel like this candle has a very strong scent. A bit disappointing. I’ll stick with Bath and Body Works.
3,2022-06-22,Didn’t have a smell to it when it was burning
1,2019-11-27,"Absolutely no scent. I have burned this candle twice now for hours at each time, on 2 separate days and can not smell anything. I can remember candles from Yankee candle shop that would make my entire house smell like I'm baking cookies. Which is what I wanted. This is not it. Wasted money, which is sad when you live on A TIGHT budget."
4,2019-09-22,"Was expecting a stronger scent from Yankee Candle given some of their other products but that's my only complaint, candle has been burning for almost 3 days straight and maybe 1/3 of the way burned through."
5,2017-05-02,SMALLS GREAT!!!!
3,2020-05-18,It lasted long enough but had very little scent.
3,2019-01-31,"something is differant; always you could count of Yankee Candle to add nice cent to the room. This one, lights easily, stays light but NO FRAGERANCE."
2,2017-12-21,"Poor fragrance quality, would not even believe it was yankee except it’s maked on the jar"
2,2019-02-03,The candle does not burn as a true yankee candle. Went right down in the middle with plenty of candle on sides.  I’ve never had a yankee do this yet both of these candles have burnt the same way.  Wasteful
1,2019-02-19,"Had high hopes for this candle as when I took off the lid and took a sniff if was very nice and pleasant to my nostrils.  However two things happened after lighting it....it has absolutely no scent and it tunnels badly.....I trimmed the wick, lit the candle and after 4 hours had a nice tunnel started.  Compared to the Autumn Wreath scent it is almost as if 2 different companies made the candles.  A complete waste of money."
2,2016-08-09,Not very fragrant
1,2022-06-04,If you’re looking for candle it’s very fragrant Dubai this it has very little to no smell smell but it does have does not smell like cupcakes not sure what it smells like it’s not appealing
4,2014-01-17,This is my favorite scent.  These candles never disappoint me.  The jar is a cute idea. I gave as xmas gift.
2,2021-12-28,"I specifically bought a Yankee candle because they always smell so good. This one has hardly any scent…and no, I don’t have Covid."
2,2020-11-18,Candle leaked in inner packaging.Red Liquid all over kid and top of  jarCould not gift this as it just looked very bad.
4,2015-09-22,There are better for the price but It does smell good and lasts a long time
1,2020-11-03,"I burned this candle for 3 hrs & it gave off no scent, at all.I grew up in MA where authentic Yankee Candles were manufactured. The reason everyone paid extra was for the extraordinary scent, which filled the New England homes.I bought 2 of these & neither of them give off any scent. Dollar store candles are better than these. Do Not  Buy"
4,2020-02-05,"I enjoyed this along with all the other candies I have purchased, used and gifted to relatives in the past years."
3,2020-04-27,The scent isn't very strong at all.
2,2021-10-18,Returned because there was no smell.
3,2021-01-27,Nice candle if you don’t want much of a scent. Expected more for a Yankee Candle.
4,2013-08-27,This candle is fine. Anything fall is great and it isn't too over whelming. Not too flowery or overly strong.
2,2021-03-24,I love Yankee candles but this was a huge disappointment.  I don't know if this scent was marked down because it old or what but even in my small bedroom with the doors closed I can hardly smell a thing and I have a really strong sense of smell.
4,2017-05-23,Nice product
3,2019-03-27,Super sticky sweet smelling. I can only burn it for a few minutes before it overwhelms me. But it does its job
1,2022-05-16,I had purchased this candle in the past and for whatever reason it isn't the same as it used to be. It does not smell the same or have the same potency as other Yankee candles I have purchased in the past. The scent used to remind me of the holidays spicy and comforting now it just smells like a cheap berry scent to me very dissatisfied.
4,2021-07-17,Did come broken but I really don’t care just a bit disappointed.
4,2021-01-11,Gifted for Christmas 2020. Gave to a girlfriend who loves the scent
3,2020-09-18,"Smells amazing, but came melted and cannot find the whick therefore cannot use it."
4,2020-09-19,not  a thing
2,2020-09-12,It will probably be broken when it arrives.1st one broken (cut my finger)2nd one..delivery driver must’ve thrown it from his truck to my front door it was so shattered!
2,2021-02-07,We can hardly smell this candle 🕯. Would not recommend.
1,2020-04-10,"It's rare, but YC seems to have produced a bad batch. I've been buying this flavor for years, but this one smells wrong - only very faint cinnamon. I don't THINK it's my nose, as other candles from last year smell ok, but what do I know. And no, I'm not sick. Take it with a nose of salt."
1,2020-09-24,"I don’t know if this spiced pumpkin candle had been shelved for too long or what but what I received was packaged oddly, with bubble wrap not in normal cardboard fitted for candles. The top showed signs that the inside was melting at some point & it smelled nothing like the Yankee Candle spiced pumpkin I’ve had in the past. I believe the candle was old."
2,2019-04-30,Wicks burn way to low. Hardly any flame and the wax almost covers them when burning.. Im very unsatisfied I wish I could get my money back. I bought 2.. Yankee candies are supposed to be the best. Same issue for both candles.
2,2021-11-17,Ok candle.  Not worth the money.
4,2018-11-08,Nice
2,2021-06-15,No smell very disappointed
1,2022-01-18,I was looking forward to receiving my yankee candle. Unfortunately I’m very disappointed. I’ve had it lit for hours now but there is no scent whatsoever from it. Shame because I used to buy them all the time. Will look elsewhere for candles.
1,2020-07-20,"The candle arrived double-boxed, however the wax inside was broken and all on one side of the jar. I melted it down to liquid wax to make it useable. I will only buy candles from Walmart where I can inspect them first. Same price there,$16.88."
1,2021-05-04,"I ordered this Yankee candle because the company is known for its great scents that you can smell through your house. This scent when you smell the candle directly has a cinnamon scent, but when you light it, the candle only has the light smell that it’s burning without any of the scent. It’s not even worth lighting because who wants a slight burning smell in their house?"
2,2020-09-28,"This smelled AMAZING when I first opened it, so I was looking forward to how my room was going to smell. Unfortunately, it gave off absolutely no scent. Even if I go up to it and sniff it when it's lit it doesn't smell like anything. When it's unlit, it smells fantastic. Not sure if I got a bad one, but needless to say, I'm disappointed."
3,2019-12-20,I love Yankee candles but this one didn’t have much scent .
1,2018-10-02,"I literally love this scent, when I buy from Yankee. This one has put off zero scent. Upon opening it I was disappointed. I gave it a light anyway. It’s been 20 minutes and nothing. Must be a knock off or cheap wax poured in yankee jars. What faint scent it did have wasn’t even the same as the real one I get. Just thankful for free returns and refunds because I feel ripped off."
2,2022-04-10,After a month's of use and 90% of the candle remaining i put the lid on just to have the glass around it break.Cannot use with jagged glass so in the trash it went:((
3,2019-09-13,The candle is great however the packing was horrible.  I’m waiting for my replacement now.
4,2018-12-22,"Looks like whoever packed it, put the lid on upside down so it was glass to glass. Could tell it was shattered before I opened the box. Maybe use something better than just a cardboard filler, like foam or bubble wrap. Smells nice at least."
3,2020-02-27,they don't smell very strongbut they look really cute
2,2017-09-12,"I LOVE the smell of these candles! However, both of mine seem to have leaked? Not sure how that happened but it did. Anyway, I'm going to keep them because they still smell really good and look full to me. I expect better shipping for such an expensive candle though."
3,2020-03-02,Scent not nearly as strong as it used to be in Yankee Candles.
3,2020-02-02,Nice looking jar with lid. Aroma is weak.
3,2020-05-06,The sent is not as strong as I expected.
3,2021-12-28,No scent. I used to love Yankee candles but now I'm not so sure
4,2018-01-23,Smells ok
2,2021-07-13,Not sure if this was a legit Yankee candle. You couldn’t smell it burning for nothing. I have a pretty strong sense of smell and couldn’t smell not even a hint of it even after burning for a couple hours. Definitely buy from an authorized retailer.
1,2021-12-31,"If I hadn't already boxed it up to return, I would attach a picture.  I took the top off the candle and it looked like it had melted in transit.  The wax was pushing up and there was no wick to be seen.  Boxed up and sent back the same day.  Will now buy Yankee Candles at Yankee Candle."
4,2018-01-30,good scent
1,2021-12-31,So i saw an article saying that people buying Yankee Candles from Amazon have no or very little scent. It was blamed on Covid...Well it is not covid because i can smell perfectly well and this Yankee candle has very little scent. So i tested and made sure by lighting a different candle from bath and body works. I was able to smell that candle perfectly. So for some reason the Yankee Candle reviews are correct by my nose.
3,2020-11-19,I am usually a huge fan of Yankee Candles. This candle is not up to par with the usual quality as far as scent goes. Can barely smell it.
2,2021-03-29,Yankee Candles have really hone downhill.We could hardly smell the fragrance
3,2022-01-06,Will be great if the power goes out and you need a candle.
2,2021-12-21,I ordered two of these candles. One came delivered perfect and the other came in ungiftable condition. It must have been on its side and melted because it came hardened at a slant in the jar with wax melted in the cover and the wick buried in the wax.
4,2020-02-02,I like the smell but it’s not strong enough for a big area
1,2022-05-31,I'm sorry to report that either Yankee candle isn't what they use to be or this isn't a TRUE Yankee candle. My glade candle is FULL of aroma with half the price. Buyer be aware!
1,2018-12-21,"Bought this ""Sparkling Cinnamon""  candle to burn for Christmas as I have loved other cinnamon I have purchased.  I am a long time customer of Yankee Candles and usually love their products, but this one is a dud.  It does not smell like cinnamon AT ALL  and whatever fragrance it has is very faint."
3,2020-01-01,DO NOT BUY ON SUSCRIBE THAT IS NOT A REALLY GOOD DEAL
3,2020-10-20,"Meh, not like pumpkin spice - more like slightly burned sweet potatoes."
4,2014-11-17,"It's a little... spicier than I expected, however, it's a good scent. No complaints here."
2,2022-01-24,candle came with glass broken. Probably will not order again. disappointed.
2,2021-12-28,There is very little fragrance.
2,2020-01-11,This candle was not of the quality that I normally get from a Yankee candle. The scent doesn’t even cover my guest bathroom.  :(
1,2021-12-04,"They are supposed to be vanilla cupcake, they have zero scent when burning. None.  I burned for a few hours and no one in the family could smell a thing.They smell good when sniffing the candle, but when burning, emits zero scent."
3,2019-11-11,Unlike Yankee candle not to have a heavy scent. Just a candle
3,2020-11-10,Smells nothing like apples or pumpkin. More like burnt caramel. :(
1,2020-10-23,I bought 5 of these for myself and my family as gifts. I feel terrible i gave these to my fam. They don’t smell like anything at all. Not my experience with yankee candles.. don’t know what to make of how not good these are.
2,2020-09-20,I  was disappointed in the scent or lack there of... usually Yankee candles have been a favorite of mine but I am disappointed in this one
1,2019-11-06,"I have bought several Yankee Candles and was very pleased with looks, burn time and scent. This candle is a very big disappointment. No discernable scent at all. Very disappointed in this product  and a waste of money for both the candles"
5,2016-11-01,The candle smelled fresh
4,2016-04-29,We like the buttercream scent but have really fallen for Silver Birch.  Yankee Candles are expensive but worth it!
1,2019-08-13,"I normally buy the Yankee Candle ""Creamy Vanilla,"" and it's very good.  I switched and tried ""French Vanilla"" because it was a few dollars less.  I guess I found out why... it had zero scent.  If you want a true vanilla scent, skip the ""French Vanilla"" and go for the ""Creamy.""  No wonder it was a few dollars less.  They saved the cost of the scent."
4,2016-12-12,The scent of the candle was not very strong but is pleasant.
5,2015-02-18,Great experience!
1,2021-09-27,Just go to the store and buy one - it's not worth it. I don't have time in my day to return it and don't want to spend my weekend driving to an amazon or ups store. Its an expensive candle to look like this when you get it. It does smell good but I suggest going to the store because it's unusable like this.
1,2022-07-26,This cinnamon candle looks like a volcano - tons of wax on sides of candles - HUGE hole in the middle -terrible waste of money - dont  recommend at all
2,2019-12-17,This didn’t burn evenly. It went straight down and the sides are still high. Hi went back to McCalls candles.
2,2020-10-03,"Not the best, just ok. Quality doesn’t live up to the price."
1,2020-08-17,"I am not impressed of this candle. I got deceived for I thought it's good when lighting this candle. I regret not taking a picture how the candle looks like when you already have the candle burning because it made the entire glass black because of the flame.Also as I was trying to finish the candle, it didn't continue lighting because there's no wick left. More left over candles as it stopped lighting."
4,2017-08-29,as expected
4,2017-06-02,nice candle.
4,2013-04-09,I like this true to life scent - very close (if in fact it's not the same) to YC's Sweet Strawberry from a few years back.
3,2020-02-21,No smell. Bummer
2,2020-11-23,"No smell , will buy somewhere else."
1,2020-01-07,Very disappointed with the 3 large holiday Yankee candles purchased.  Faint scent when opened.  Thought perhaps candles needed to burn for scent to come through.  Nothing.  Wondering if they were old and scent had evaporated.  Most large candles were approximately $30 each; the 3 I purchased were half that.
3,2019-01-14,"Ordered 5 of these candles as gifts. One of the 5 was melted a bit, so not good for gifting."
1,2021-11-22,I read the reviews and figured I’d give the Sparkling Cinnamon a shot. Quite disappointed. The flame flickers heavily producing an extra amount of stinky smoke and the cinnamon smell is nonexistent.
2,2019-02-15,There were color changes in the candle and many imperfections visible through the glass. Normally this is a smooth solid color. I bought this for a gift but wasn't comfortable gifting it with this appearance.
3,2018-11-10,Didn’t smell when lit. I couldn’t smell it after it was lit and it didn’t have the quality most YC do for some reason.
2,2020-12-22,First time ever ordering Yankee candles there was “no wick”  So looking forward to enjoying it. No luck!
3,2019-01-09,Not much scent. First time buyer of a Yankee candle. Purchased four wish I had not !
1,2018-10-26,My family absolutely loves the cinnamon fragrance of this candle. we only wish that it was available year-round.I originally gave this candle an excellent review because in the past I have loved the fragrance.However with this particular candle we continually have problems with the wick.  The the candle keeps burning out because of the wick.  I think it is defective
1,2018-03-28,"Burning a hole right down the middle of the candle, leaving a half inch ring of solid wax as it goes. :-(  Very disappointed to have a Yankee candle do this."
3,2020-01-27,Smelt better in the store.
3,2020-02-22,Did not burn evenly and about 1/3 was wasted
1,2017-10-25,Is this a legit Yankee Candle? I have been burning this for over an hour and I cannot smell it if I am more than one foot away. Complete waste of money.
1,2019-11-16,"""A heartwarming blend of cinnamon, baking spices, and a hint of freshly poured tea""???NOPE. A foul smell of wax and oil. Very gross smell. Very fond of Yankee candles, but this one is BAD! Returning to Amazon, regardless that its been lit and burned for 20 minutes.SKIP IT"
1,2022-03-17,This candle burned at such a low flame that it burned a hole down into the wax without melting half of it. I've never had this problem with Yankee Candles before this purchase.
4,2020-04-07,Bought this as a gift bc of a good deal.
2,2019-05-30,Received candle today opened the box and the jar was shattered. It smells great but is of no use to me. It cannot be burned or gifted.
3,2021-01-19,Not as strong in fragrance as other Yankee Candles.
1,2021-12-26,I thought this Yankee candle would offer a aroma that would permeate the house. It doesn’t even smell! I will never purchase this product again! Not worth the money! I don’t mind paying for a candle as long as I can smell it. This one doesn’t! Don’t waste your time or money.
2,2014-05-15,"My kids bought this for me for Mother's Day and while I love it for that reason alone, I am extremely disappointed that the smell doesn't carry well. It is strong in the unlit candle but once lit, it is nonexistent. Yankee candles were the best of the best but I couldn't be more disappointed in a candle."
5,2014-10-31,Wonderful homey smell!
1,2019-12-30,"Had very little scent. It seems like perhaps it was old. I bought one at the Yankee Candle Store and it smelled very good. This one you can only smell if you hold it up to your nose. Although the price was good, it only provides candle light. It also smokes a lot when disguised."
3,2018-07-01,Scent must have changed at some point over the years. It's now more butterscotch scent instead of creamy.
3,2018-12-08,I didn't want this after you see you need to stick the black pad on the wall.  Stinks that such a light item costs $8 to return
2,2021-07-30,Smells great if you're right next to it but it doesn't fill a room.
1,2020-12-22,"For a candle, it functions well. For a Yankee Candle, definitely not the quality I’m used to. The top looked like it had melted some but I didn’t order it during any extreme heat. I’ve also burned the candle twice now and it doesn’t give off any smell, which is why I purchased it."
2,2021-12-01,"The scent was nonexistent. I ordered another one. Hopefully, it is better than this one. I'd hate to get another dud."
1,2019-12-06,"I love yankee candles. That’s the only brand I buy. I light candies everyday. BUT , this candle gives off no scent at all. I don’t think it’s a real yankee candle. The price was much lower that is why I bought it. I bought another scent as well and it does not give off any scent either."
2,2020-10-08,This candle is not worth the money. There is no scent. Yankees candles can usually be smelled through the whole house.  Not this one. Dont waste your money!
4,2020-11-04,If vanilla is your thing
1,2021-12-11,"Very fake sent, jar not sealed, making it awkward to give as a gift."
3,2020-12-07,The smell was not as strong as I expected but it was still nice..I LOVE yankee candles
4,2011-12-05,"I bought this for our living room and it smells absolutely delicious! Smells very sweet and very strong so definitely recommended for larger rooms. The only thing is that it's quite a pricey candle but then again, they are great quality candles."
3,2018-11-17,Didn't burn well not very strong aroma
1,2020-10-21,Very disappointed in these candles. Very little to no  fragrance. I burned and also tried to even use as a tart melt. I would not suggest this candle if you’re looking for a scented candle
2,2018-09-20,They didn't have a very strong fragrance like most Yankee candles have.
3,2019-12-16,Scent not strong at all
3,2018-12-14,smells good but wax looked weird upon arrival... hoping its actual yankee candle and not something homemade haha
4,2017-02-01,worth the money
4,2016-12-02,Buy it again....
3,2019-11-22,Scent isnt like normal yankee candle
3,2019-12-11,Not much aroma!
3,2017-12-21,"The wick is too small for the candle and it tunnels badly. Other than that, good product."
4,2020-02-14,"The scent is strong when you directly smell the candle itself, but not when you light it up."
4,2018-06-18,STRONGly scented.
4,2016-12-17,they made great gifts
1,2020-11-10,"I'm going with the other reviews of the sparkling cinnamon.  If it is authentic, it's definitely not up to standards of Yankee Candle.  It isn't burning evenly and has an ""off"" aroma.  My family never comments on my candle obsession, but each one has asked me to throw this one away."
2,2021-02-25,"I have used Yankee candles for many years; however, I was disappointed from this scent. It was very weak and you can barely smell it.It’s has a flowery scent, but you have to be very close to it to smell."
1,2020-09-22,It's FAKE!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!! We've been using Yankee candles for a decade now and this is the first time that we had a Yankee candle that doesn't have a scent/smell at all even for hours of burning. Another thing is it melts and easily. I'm definitely reporting this to Yankee Candle company.
1,2022-03-12,You can’t smell anything. Will not purchase again.
2,2010-11-20,"""Home Sweet Home 22 oz Classic Candle by Yankee Candle is a familiar, welcoming seasonal blend of cinnamon, cloves, pine, cedar, smoked firewood and vanilla. ""Not so much.  I honestly only noticed mild cinnamon and vanilla.  I just expect a stronger, but rich and true scent from Yankee."
1,2019-11-21,"I bought 4 candles because they were the special of the day. I have burned 2 out of 4 and you CANNOT smell the scent. I think they were old candles and that is why they were on sale, I am So very disappointed!! I love a great smelling candle but will never buy yankee candle again."
3,2022-06-17,I was hoping for a more intense vanilla aroma. This was disappointing.
2,2020-04-21,Unfortunately this lets off very little scent. Candle burns nice though.
4,2007-01-19,"the candle is nice but a little pricey, you can go to the candle store locally and get two for the price i spent on this one."
4,2018-12-16,It’s big and it smells great
2,2012-11-27,"For such an expensive candle, I expected more.  The smell was way too faint for me.  The candle also burned rather quickly."
4,2020-01-12,Love this autumn scent
1,2017-03-07,DISAPPOINTED! THE CANDLES HAVE NO FRAGRANCE!  I PLAN TO RETURN BOTH CANDLES.  BUYER BEWARE.
2,2014-01-07,"Even when I first opened the jar, the scent was not as strong as other fragrances in Yankee Candles that I have.  And while burning the candle I barely noticed the fragrance while in the same room.  Nice if you run out of power and need a little light."
1,2020-01-30,The “Home Sweet Home” candle has absolutely no scent! It’s virtually fragrance free! Complete waste of money. I’m highly disappointed.
2,2021-03-19,This candle smells great.  However it burns straight down the middle leaving 50% of the wax on the side of the Jar.I am going back to my old brand that is 65% cheaper and burns longer and 95% of the wax
1,2022-04-26,I've seen a few different reviews about how fake candles burn uneven.. These were for sure fake. Had no scent at all and burned completely uneven.Never buying these again.
1,2022-01-07,This candle does not smell like any of the other sparkling cinnamon candles I have had. It has zero cinnamon smell and now my house smells like rancid wax. It's horrible!
2,2019-02-07,Sorry guys for the $25 these little babies Ron you don’t get that many more hours out of him you’re getting skimpier skin beer with the sent
3,2019-02-19,La mecha era corta y me dejo la cera casi por la mitad
2,2022-02-04,Thought I would try these....Big Mistake....Burns down the center....These guys should be ashamed...
1,2022-03-11,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
 Thr candle looks legit. But, scent is not legit, it does not burn well. This is a fake I bought on Amazon. Buyer go elsewhere!"
4,2015-01-01,Smelled great like all yankee candles but I still wish they were a little cheaper.
3,2021-08-25,I've bought yankee candles for years and I've never been this disappointed. Barely any smell to it at all.
2,2021-06-19,"Item arrived undamaged and smelled great before lighting, but there is little scent while the candle is actually burning."
1,2021-11-04,I bought 4 different scents and none have any scent when they are lit. I wanted an Eucalyptus candle and they were almost $25 and now they are over $35. They have got to be kidding.
2,2020-05-29,Over priced. Weak scent. Very disappointed
4,2020-01-09,Love the smell of citrus and sageGreat sale price too
3,2020-09-16,Great product and smells amazing but the jar was cracked when I opened it. Be careful opening since I almost cut my finger. Maybe needs some bubble wrap with packaging.
1,2021-12-28,"I used to love, and only buy, Yankee Candles... however, this purchase, the candles had NO scent to them at all.  Even after burning for hours, nothing.  I'm so upset, especially due to the cost we pay for these candles"
1,2020-09-17,I  ordered 4 Sparkling Cinnamon candles and upon arrival 2 had leaked wax out of the container and were a mess.One other candle has very little scent. When the box was delivered I picked it up immediately so it wasn't subject to hot weather and melting once it was delivered.
1,2018-10-10,"Was so excited to get this candle today after everything I’ve heard about it ! I can’t even light it as the wick is buried somewhere in what looks like wax that’s melted . Now it needs returned . The candle smells really good , too bad I can’t light it . Would only risk buying this if you don’t mind the hassle of return shipping !"
3,2017-02-05,I expected a lot more of the good smells  throughout the house for the money. .... I could have got the same results from a  $3 walmart candle
4,2016-11-18,Not much smell
4,2017-05-11,I love this scent and burn the candles all year round. thanks.
2,2018-01-17,"I was disappointed that the candle lacked a good ""throw.""  I usually purchase B&BW candles which, in my opinion, do much better.  Two stars for the length of burning time.."
4,2020-11-01,Nice fall candle
4,2019-07-18,For making the house smell good
2,2020-04-11,I was disappointed when my candle arrived with a badly broken jar.I understood it was on sale but it seemed dangerous & I wasn’t comfortable bringing all of the pieces in an effort to return it.
3,2021-12-12,""
4,2020-01-07,I love these candles they always smell so good.
1,2022-08-07,This has no scent at all. The lid is not a Yankee lid. This is definitely not a Yankee candle. Save your money.
1,2022-08-16,This has always been one of my favorite fall candles. But there's hardly any scent to these candles. So very disappointed.
2,2018-02-13,"I am very disappointed with this candle.  Yankee's reputation is that the wicks are always centered.  Well, mine sure wasn't; therefore the candle is not burning correctly."
5,2017-09-28,Yankee candle brand candles have the strongest and longest lasting scents.
1,2021-07-27,"No scent whatsoever. For a candle that costs this much, the scent should last longer than 1 hour. 95% of the candle still left and there is no scent. Total waste of money. Could’ve bought a better, cheaper candle at the dollar store."
2,2019-04-18,I have been trying to find a great chocolate candle because my husband only likes chocolate scents... Ordered this one and it smelled awesome but it did not burn clean at all. There's alot of wasted wax around the edge of the jar😡. I think that's called tunneling? For $23 dollars I expected a better quality...
1,2021-11-30,Yankee candles used to have an intense scent.  Other reviews mentioned that they have changed for the worst.  I will not buy the Brand again.  It’s really sad.
1,2022-03-19,"Think I might have gotten a fake Yankee candle.  When lit, it has absolutely zero scent.  Have bought this same candle locally and it had a great scent.  This  one, nothing."
4,2020-03-03,Fragrance
5,2014-11-10,loved it
3,2019-02-21,Wish the scent was stronger...but over all good
1,2022-05-29,"This candle is either a fake or the brand is just awful now.  Where is the fragrance/scent? No,  Not even close to what I used to get. Just- no. Returning."
4,2014-06-14,Strong and long lasting. Great spring scent I was a little vary on the scents of lime and vanilla together but it is awesome!
1,2015-04-16,no scent to it.
3,2018-05-06,overpriced just like all yankee candles even with 2 wicks it does not burn evenly
2,2020-04-02,Not stong at all; purchased 3 because of the positive reviews and was sorely disappointed. Very faint / even with all three burning
2,2022-03-21,It smells funky not really like chocolate at all.
2,2022-02-02,Glass broken although it was packaged in the cardboard container that Yankee Candle uses.
1,2020-10-06,"I think this candle is a fake....this is my favorite fall scent, but this candle that I just wasted $17.00 on smells like burning wax....it seriously has ZERO SCENT! Not even a hint of Spiced Pumpkin...I definitely think this is a fake Yankee Candle! Buyer beware!"
3,2018-11-25,Too pricey for how long it lasts. Does smell really good.
1,2018-12-21,"Hardly smells like a Yankee Candle should!I've been buying only Yankee Candles for years, the quality of the candle has declined so much I'm not even sure it's been lit. Cant smell them anymore, this scent should fill a small room very well, it does not."
2,2021-08-24,"The candle smells nice, no problems there. But when I received it, I guess the heat melted the candle while on its side, so I received a jar of unusable scented wax"
4,2014-08-01,Nicely packaged and good instructions
1,2019-01-24,So disappointed. I always purchase yankee candies because they are highly scented. This candle has no scent at all when lit.
1,2015-05-12,"I've bought many kinds of Yankee candles and have always thought it was worth it to spend a little more (when i could afford it) for a candle you can be sure will fill your room with a great scent. This particular scent (Spiced Pumpkin) blew that theory. It was a dud. Maybe the manufacturer was having problems that particular day. Hardly a scent detected. If Cinnamon is a 100, this is a 1."
1,2020-08-25,Very disappointed in this candle. I expected to receive a nice candle that would fill my small apartment with the smell of spiced pumpkin. I can barely smell anything. DO NOT BUY this candle. It is not worth  what it cost. I will not buy a Yankee candle again.
1,2020-03-02,"I don't know what happen to Yankee Candle, but I bought this as a gift and also bought one for myself. I was so embraced to find there's no fragrance in mine. I've been embraced to ask about hers. I won't buy another one."
2,2017-12-26,"This is the first Yankee Candle Scent I am not impressed with. I can barely smell it, so I won't buy the Vanilla Cupcake scent again."
1,2020-10-31,I opened the boxes and the two candles sprayed red wax all over everything on my desk and the floor.  I have used Yankee Candles for years and never had this issue. Not happy with the mess.  I have recently purchased a few other scents and did not have this issue.
2,2015-12-11,Very pungent... Too pungent
4,2017-01-16,You can't go wrong with Yankee candles!
3,2019-11-24,"Disappointed in scent, or lowness of scent"
1,2022-06-18,"not much scent. lit for over four hours, with very little smell in room. i will go back to village brand,"
2,2022-01-02,The candle smelled good but wasn't as strong as I thought it would be. It did last a long time.
1,2022-04-22,"yankee has finally tanked. This is my fave scent and hard to find but NO scent!Good-bye Yankee, Hello Village!"
3,2019-03-10,Didn't like the smell of this candle!
2,2019-04-08,Great scent...a favorite of mine. It arrived broken.
2,2020-07-25,Didn’t seem to last long for the price. The bath and body works candles give off a more powerful smell.
2,2020-09-30,The sent is nice when it’s not burning but you smell nothing once it’s lit.
2,2019-01-04,I was very disappointed with the scent of this candle. It was too soft. Great candle if you are looking for a soft scent.
3,2013-11-19,This is my first Yankee candle. The smell is exacly as described but it's not a favorite of mine. This is just as good as Salt City in intensity. Next time I'll get a Peach scent.
1,2022-03-14,Bought this Yankee candle  for my friend's bday.  I was so disgusted when I opened package and candle appeared to be used.  The wick was scorched from prior burning and the wax was 1/3 depleted.  For $12 this was a big rip off and disappointment!
2,2020-10-18,This is one of my favorite scents from Yankee Candle but this candle Has almost no scent unlike the ones I have bought directly from yankee candle. Disappointing.
1,2017-11-11,I am so dissatisfied with this candle. I have burned it every day since I received it and there is NO SMELL AT ALL!! I burn other candles and I can smell fragrance within 5 minutes. I am returning it if I can. This has happened with other Yankee Candles and I will not be purchasing any more.
1,2021-11-12,Very disappointed and upset said not eligible for return.
4,2020-09-09,Smells like new not stale. Love yankee
1,2021-12-02,"Evidently candle was stored in very hot environment. Unable to light wick, definitely NOT appropriate  as a gift. Red wax melted on top staining it."
1,2020-10-22,I have left this burning for two days. There is absolutely no sense whatsoever. Yankee candles I have gone in the toilet the last two years.
3,2018-02-07,"I love yankee candles and don’t buy any bigger brand, this flavor is a little too pungent"
1,2021-10-23,"These candles WERE my favorite~But very unhappy with the poor quality. They burn black soot on jar, faint smell and burn fast.I will be searching for a new brand."
2,2021-10-10,There’s hardly any sense at all
3,2021-10-08,Scent was almost nonexistent
1,2022-05-03,I like this candle but it has gone up another $2.00.  Got to put your foot down somewhere.  I'll go without.
4,2016-07-27,"Good price, smells great"
3,2019-12-19,Weak smell
1,2020-08-30,I BARELY smell this candle!!!! very disappointed i thought yankee candle made good strong smelling candles???either its the scent the candle or both not worth it stick to BATH AND BODY WORKS THIS IS LIKE A LARGE CHEAP DOLLAR TREE CANDLE GARBAGE!!
2,2019-02-11,"Must’ve gotten the bad batch...burned terribly uneven, hardly a scent.  Not the Usnkee Candle I’m used to buying! ☹️"
1,2020-12-01,"Very disappointed. This candle had zero scent. I burned it for several hours and could not detect any scent after being outside and coming into the house. Smelled great when I took the lid off, but that’s where it ended."
3,2019-06-25,👌🏼
2,2021-09-25,"There's minimum ""spice"" to the pumpkin, and it really doesn't even have a strong enough scent to make our little bathroom smell good."
3,2018-05-31,Overpriced candle that doesn't give off much fragrence when burning.
2,2020-09-08,The wax was melted before it was delivered so I am unable to light it
2,2021-10-21,Smells good sticking your nose in it unlit but can't smell it when it matters. Even guests who just arrived couldn't smell it.
1,2020-02-03,I gave this as a gift for Christmas only to find out the glass was shattered. It was to late to get a refund or a replacement since it was over a month from the time I bought it until it was opened on Christmas.
4,2019-12-18,Like
2,2020-12-25,"This particular scent, cinnamon, was very weak.  The other scents I ordered were lovely, and filled the room."
1,2022-01-28,Nothing I like about this candle. It only burns in the center of the candle about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Can’t even smell the scent in the candle.  Don’t waste your time or money on this product. Is this a Yankee Candle ???????????
2,2020-01-09,Candle tunneled leaving wax against glass.  Initial burn was for  3+hours.  Trying to remedy this by tenting with aluminum foil.  I'll try a different brand or get one with multiple wicks. Had better luck with MainStays from Walmart.
2,2016-11-29,Apple Pumpkin has very little scent and I mean VERY LITTLE. Nothing like my old Cinnamon Stick Yankee candle.  This might not be the real thing. I have no way of knowing but I would not recommend.
3,2020-10-10,I purchased 4 of these candles (love the smell and gave 3 away as gifts). The candle i kept did not have a wick. First time i've ever received a candle from Yankee that does not have a wick.
1,2020-01-24,I’m wondering where these Yankee candles came from.They do not burn like the Yankee candles I have had in the past. I don’t know if it’s because I ordered it from Amazon in their second products or what it is but they do not burn like my normal Yankee candles always have
2,2019-03-26,For the price of what I paid for the candle and no smell I was not a very pleased customer
3,2017-03-24,"I usually love Yankee Candles, but this lost its scent after the second burning."
2,2022-01-31,Very disappointed with the scent
5,2016-12-17,Yankees are  the best
4,2015-11-21,Christmas gift
1,2021-12-08,I am so disappointed in this candle. I hadn't bought a Yankee Candle in years. I saw this one and remembered how much I loved their scents. I burned this one for hours at a time on several different occasions and I couldn't even tell I had a candle lit. There were no smell.
1,2021-11-20,"This is not a real Yankee Candle, it smells nothing like a real Yankee Candle and looks weird, like it’s been filled over a real candle. Awful!!!"
2,2019-07-29,"The smell is ok to me, but my husband thinks it smells horrible."
1,2021-11-18,I ordered my Yankee Candle Vanilla Cupcake Scent yesterday and received it today (great!) The only problem is that these candles purchased through Amazon doesn't have that exuberant smell of a Yankee Candle like it did in the 90's via the Yankee Candle store where I live. I don't normally pay much for candles but I liked this price...too bad...money wasted...I will stick with Bath & Body Works!
2,2020-02-20,Not as much scent as I’d like for the price paid
1,2020-08-10,This just showed up. It smells great because it is a melty mess out the top of the jar. The lid has been pushed off with the wax. Super disappointed this is how it arrived. Will be sending back for a new one.
1,2021-10-26,Had it shipped to my niece in Nevada as a gift. She said it smells wonderful but arrived melted unable to burn so she cut it out piece by piece to use in her wax burner instead.
1,2021-12-04,Honestly I’m a huge yankee candle fan and have always been satisfied with my purchases  outside of Amazon. I don’t know why the product totally lacks scent! a dollar store candle in my opinion has more smell and for the price I paid I feel ripped off. Guys DON’T BUY!! At least not through Amazon
3,2020-03-02,Love the scent..it fills the room.  And it lasts a long time
4,2017-06-26,"Very good, gave to a friend who loved it"
2,2017-05-01,nice candle but loses its scent after several uses.
2,2018-11-21,Must have been an old candle. The fragrance is nowhere near as strong as other Yankee Candles I have purchased.
1,2021-03-19,This candle was no big deal smell wise. What smell is question. I wanted my room to smell beautiful and basically this is just a red candle. Also the two wicks are not required it almost takes away from relaxing vibe as the seems to vibrant and strong.
2,2019-01-16,"Have used around 1/5 and it caught fire, Two wick is a fire hazard, do not leave unattended."
2,2019-03-26,For the price of what I paid for the candle and no smell I was not a very pleased customer
2,2019-03-26,For the price of what I paid for the candle and no smell I was not a very pleased customer
1,2021-11-18,"The luscious scent filled the air the first evening.  I think the top part is the only area where it was infused.  After that, couldn’t even tell I had a candle burning."
1,2020-11-24,This candle is completely unusable!  It has NO wick to light and it seems have it was melted and then formed wrong.  I can't believe how bad it is.  I will need a replacement or refund.  Very disappointed n this Yankee Candle purchase.I was sent a replacement and the glass was broken.  What a waste.  Poor packaging.  2 candles sent in a week and both were damaged.
1,2021-01-08,I have been purchasing Yankee Candles in their store and on Amazon for a long time and this is the first time I have been disappointed.  There is no scent at all.  Not even a whiff.  What a waste of money.
3,2019-12-13,Not as strong of a scent as I remember
2,2020-03-01,I could not smell any scent.
1,2020-12-26,"I have purchased Yankee Candles for years and been very satisfied.  However, I think they forgot to add the french vanilla scent to this candle.  It smells like....nothing!  And the same candle in years past has smelled great, so I don't know what happened to this one."
1,2021-11-04,No scent to the candle. My local Hallmark closed and I thought I had found my Yankee source. The candle had absolutely NO scent at all.
1,2016-02-19,"Never written a review before and never had a problem with Amazon but the candle that came is NOT the spiced pumpkin that's pictured. This one is a different jar, different label and says ""Yankee Candle Home Classics Pumpkin Spice"". None of that would bother me if it smelled like the regular Spiced Pumpkin but it doesn't.  It has a sharper, more chemical smell, similar to some of the cheaper candles I've purchased over the years. Very disappointed."
1,2022-05-12,Worst Yankee candle of all. I guess that is why it is only 16$. Does not burn correctly. Terrible
2,2019-10-05,"Very poor quality. Nothing like the original Yankee Candle.  About 1/4 of the wax is left around the edge of the glass jar, and does not melt.  It’s like a candle you would purchase at a dollar store."
3,2021-02-03,The scent was not as strong as other yankee Candles I have had. I could hardly notice when it was burning. Quality not what I am used to.
1,2022-01-07,"The replacement for my shattered, 28 dollar Yankee Candle is a no brand, no jar no packaging of any kind cheap candle. Very disappointing."
2,2020-11-28,If you smell the candle before lighting it smells like vanilla. But once you light the wicks no scent emanates from the candle. You might as well light an unscented candle.
1,2021-11-07,"The candle had melted and rehardened, either in storage.  Reordered.  Same problem.  Kept the first candle, with full refund.  Second candle also had melted and I returned it.  Got a refund but I think shipping was not refunded.  Should have been great product but severely damaged."
2,2020-11-23,This candle has zero scent. I have never had a Yankee Candle with no smell. Is this a fake?
1,2021-10-29,Unfortunately this thing you can’t even smell unless your sticking your nose in it. I tossed it out after under a week. You can save a lot of money going to your local Walmart and getting a Pumpkin Spice Candle. Don’t waste your money-I thought Yankee was supposed to be a good brand.
5,2013-12-23,"Yankee Candles have always been my favorite.  They burn as they should and, based on your personal preferences, the fragrances are pleasant."
1,2021-01-14,"Very disapointed in the scent of this Yankee Candle Vanilla Cupcake. This is the second of Vanilla Cupcake I ordered in just one months' time. The first one ordered in December 2020 had a wonderful aroma while burning, that lasted throughout 30 days. However this second Vanilla Cupcake candle, while burning, has almost no aroma at all."
1,2020-01-17,Yankee Candles are extremely expensive but we buy them because they are extra smelly. That is not the case with this product. I am sincerely impressed by how little scent it produces. Waste of money. Totally baffled. Would be upset if it weren't a completely absurd thing for me to spend money on in the first place.
1,2021-11-22,I could have opened a stick of gum and had more scent. Yankee Candle has become a joke. DON'T  WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP.
5,2012-12-28,"This was a Christmas present for my mother. She specifically requested this flavor, and I wanted to do shopping online instead of the stores."
1,2021-11-20,The CANDLEWAS RECEIVED MELTED INTO A WEIRD WAX SHAPE -WITH NO WICK !!!I PAID FOR NOTHING !
2,2021-02-27,received. Love Yankee candles but why does this one. Cinnamon n ot burn properly. I just bought 4 and none of them burned right. Yes I trim the wick. What a waste of money! May have to go to different brand.
1,2021-10-25,This is my 2nd candle from them and there is hardly a smell. I had a few ppl to come into my small apartment and they thought the same. Sucks because it’s a great price :://
1,2019-11-02,It took too nights (one of which was my annual Halloween party) to realize this candle DOES NOT have a scent!! I’m convinced it’s fake. Can’t say for sure but this burned for 6 hours and barely caught a whiff of anything. Took me tonight to realize this was a dud.  Returning with a vengeance.
2,2019-09-26,Not crazy about this one at All. No scent
3,2019-06-30,Not a strong scent
2,2018-10-28,"The price was great, but they must be old candles as they hardly had any fragrance when burned. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,2020-09-04,"I know how to burn candles...light, get a full melt pool before extinguishing.  Not with with brand...I have a huge tunnel right down the middle of the jar. Complete waste of money. I’ll stick to Village Candles."
1,2019-01-01,"We recently purchased a half-dozen or more of these Yankee candles before Christmas in 6-7 diffrrent fragrances, and the cinnamon one is the worst of the lot. It has NO cinnamon aroma to it whatsoever. Save your money."
1,2021-03-25,"From day one it had no scent, the candle is right next to me and I still can't smell it. I purchased a YC because I have always heard that they are great candles for the best value. I don't blow out my candle I smother it with the top. I normally use mist automatic airfreshner like glade or airwick but it was getting expensive, so I figured I'd just get a candle. Boy am I disappointed ☹️!!"
1,2021-11-23,"Wax is not melting evenly. Wax build up on one side affects the burn time and appearance.  Disappointed as Yankee Candle has always been my ""go to"".  Poor quality on this one. 🤔☹"
1,2020-10-17,"Found this on prime day and ordered it for a sweetest day gift for my wife. Candle looked like it had melted. The top was slanted and there was wax on half of the lid. The outside of the glass was partially coated with wax. There was no seal on the lid, causing me to wonder if this was returned and then resold as new? If the candle had been stored in an upright position, I think this would not have happened. At any rate, I don't think I will be purchasing any more Yankee Candles from Amazon!"
1,2021-11-09,"I am not usually a fan of Yankee Candles, but I was purchased by so many reviews. When I opened the package, I noticed the scent was mild, and when lit, the candle didn’t put out any scent at all! And of course, it isn’t returnable!! Do not waste your money."
2,2019-12-26,It was melted and deformed.
2,2019-06-12,"This candle looked very nice, but after lighting it a couple of times - I couldn't smell it."
1,2018-11-14,"Thought I would splurge and spend $20 on a Yankee candle instead of cheap ones. Disappointed! I thought they were supposed to be really good and strong fragrant. This Pumkin Spice barely, I’m not even kidding, barely smells like vanilla. I like the cheap Walmart candles better!"
2,2020-03-14,"It arrived quickly but I could tell it was a secondIt wasn’t aromatic very long, but love the smell"
1,2021-08-26,Send this candle back
3,2018-11-01,quick burning
4,2020-01-10,"Smell not deep, just superficial!"
1,2020-10-02,No scent at all my pumpkin dish soap in bottle has more shell closed than this did burning for 6 hours really disappointing wish I’d bought bath and body works brands they actually smell for the price
1,2017-09-05,Won't Buy Again
3,2018-02-01,"Smells nice, but isn't as fragrant as I hoped it would be."
1,2020-07-26,Absolutely NOT vanilla nor cupcake more lile nothing smell and very orange color It supposed to be a light beige or creamy yellow color I will stick with bath and body or a higher end candle Highly disappointed
1,2021-12-30,Seller.  Your scents. Have changed.  They are weaker or have no scent. Check out your 2020 and 2021 reviews.
1,2020-11-22,I have always loved Yankee Candles because they have a full and fragrant scent but I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.  This Cinnamon large jar has absolutely no scent at all.  It was an expensive jar of wax.  I don’t know that I will ever feel comfortable purchasing a Yankee Candle ever again.
1,2021-04-17,This is the 2nd Yankee candle I have purchased on Amazon that had no scent at all. I bought this same scent a few months ago and loved it. Very disappointed.
1,2021-12-07,This used to be my absolute favorite candle. I was so confused when I burned it and I could not smell it. I had burned a different brand of candle shortly before this one and it smelled wonderful. I've tried setting it on a table right next to my chair and I still can't smell it. Huge disappointment and waste of money.
1,2020-11-23,"I ordered the French Vanilla and got this instead. First of all that does not look or smell like the item I ordered, which obviously it is not. If it smelled really good I might forget the mixup, but it smelled like a bar of soap at best. Secondly, look at the photo the candle looks deformed and not well done. Was looking forward to my candle and what a bummer. Will return and get correct one but what a hassle. Now my office will continue smelling unpleasant lol."
3,2020-03-18,Very low scent level compared to other Yankee Candles I have purchased.
3,2015-06-24,"I like the smell of this vanilla lime, but I was expecting it to be a bit stronger.  I will not be purchasing this again."
3,2018-03-28,Love/Hate relationship with this smell.
2,2017-12-22,I bought this for the scent and it has little or no scent. Certainly unlike prior Yankee Candles and not at all worth the price.
1,2022-01-17,As soon I took lid off entire glass housing broke and cracked in pieces. Unable to burn.
2,2018-12-15,It is okay but not as strong quality scent as more costly 1s of these.
3,2020-05-13,Not a very potent fragrant.
2,2018-04-06,Won't buy Yankee Candle again.  It burned straight down into a funnel shape leaving a whole lot of unused wax. I paid a lot for not much of a burning candle.
1,2020-04-03,This candle was virtually scentless. I burned it for two afternoons and got no scent filling my home. The quality was very disappointing and it’s being sent back.
1,2018-11-14,This candle was delivered withOUT a wick!!!! useless.
2,2012-11-27,"I ordered this by name instead of by smell; which I normally do, This candle smells more like chocolate than pumpkin. I won't buy it again nor would I recommend it if your looking for something that smells like pumpkin pies."
1,2021-10-28,I own 40 plus Yankee candles… I rotate seasonally… I’ve owned this so I realize this is old or fake…I got NOTHING … read about fakes is this possible? 😰
4,2019-08-02,I liked the scent. Made my room smell like dessert.
1,2021-07-27,Arrived w glass shattered. I had purchased this Happy Birthday candle for my mums birthday but couldn’t give it to her. (See pic)
1,2022-08-16,I purchased 4 pumpkin spice candles for close to $70 and I can’t smell them AT ALL!! The febreeze candles are much cheaper and actually make your home smell good. I would not purchase these again. 0/10…a refund would be great so I could buy candles that actually work.
1,2022-01-03,"I have had SO MANY Yankee Candles and this is the one that had zero scent!! It's not worth it. All 3 that I got (Caramel, Christmas Cookie, and Vanilla Cupcake) are either FAKE or super old stocks that the perfume has long dried up. And they are also full priced except the Christmas Cookie one. Dissapointed. Don't buy!!"
1,2019-06-16,This is not the buttercream scent! It smells awful. I purchased this and the French vanilla which I have bought for years from a Yankee candle store or from Bed Bath and Beyond. Neither smell like they should...not even close. These are cheap candles with the YC label. Will not purchase again.
2,2021-08-23,Isnt really Buttercream smelling. More like Vanilla Cupcake.
2,2021-03-15,Sadly a very non-descript scent. Not reminiscent of fall and Thanksgiving.  Only good thing I can say is it burns quite completely and lasts a long time.
2,2021-07-05,"I bought 4 on prime day, they have no smell to them so disappointed in this yankee candle. Actually wondering if it is a dupe"
2,2021-09-28,Candle is very old and had very little fragrance at all. You can tell it has been sitting on a shelf for a long time. Not happy 🙁
2,2019-03-13,smell did not fill room and did not burn very well
3,2017-11-16,Love this scent and size. I don't feel like the scent is very strong though.
1,2020-02-09,I am really disappointed because I bought this candle thinking that it was a real Yankee candle and you can't even smell anything I knew it was to good to be true I only pay $10 for this candle I will never buy this candles from here again.
2,2012-11-15,"Let me start off by saying that this Yankee candle is an 'alright' candle. But we all know Yankee candles are not cheap, and should be the best of the best. Unfortunately for me it was very mild in aroma and came across to me as being rather weak in changing the fragrance of a room. I love vanilla-ish candle scents (creme brulee, cupcake, pumpkin too) but this candle did not really make my living room smell of vanilla or cupcake.I wouldn't recommend this to someone wanting a great vanilla scent, it did not deliver."
1,2020-12-10,"This candle will not burn, I have never had this happen to a candle. When i tip it side ways to light it with a lighter water runs out it like it been wet. The wick must be wet, it will not take a flame. I have always bought Yankee candles and never have had this happen before."
2,2019-09-23,Can’t smell it at all. Disappointed
2,2019-11-11,No fragrance at all
1,2021-10-12,First one was broken. No scent whatsoever on replacement. Been using yankee candles for 20 plus years.
1,2021-02-13,The candle came fine but once you light it it doesn't have a scent at all. Waste of money better off buying from a store like tjmax.  Amazon always ends up selling counterfeit products.
2,2021-07-13,Smells great in the jar but when you're burning you really can't smell it Was not too happy about that
2,2019-11-26,"I have tons of other yankee candles, and I absolutely LOVE them. This one just didn’t do it for me. It really lacks scent."
1,2021-12-02,Total disappointment
2,2020-02-27,Good for decorations!
1,2020-12-18,"Ok, weird. It smells like cinnamon candy a bit when you smell it. Light it? No scent. At all. I used to love Yankee Candles but if this is what I am getting, no more."
1,2020-12-31,I have bought a Yankee Pumpkin scented candle for years.  This one did not live up to my expectations.  There was not much scent and the candle burnt very quickly.
2,2021-03-24,Did not burn well and had almost no scent.
1,2021-11-16,candle came in bubble wrap and glass was completely shattered. tried to get exchanged but was told (by conputer voice” )i could only return it! 2 others that came in same shiiment were in individual boxes and were perfect
1,2021-03-20,"I don't know if it's the seller selling old candles or if Yankee candle has dropped the ball, but this candle had absolutely no scent! what a waste of $20!"
1,2021-12-08,This came melted badly. The wick is buried inside the wax. There’s no way to use it!
4,2013-04-03,"It fit my candle holder perfectly but, I would of like a little stronger scent.  A little high priced because I have gotten cheaper candles that smelled even stronger.  Thanks!"
3,2019-05-04,"Item damaged, top of glass jar was shattered and broken.  I have a photo of damAges ."
1,2017-09-26,"I normally order my candles on Amazon, but the candle that was delivered was defective; the wax melted onto one side; wax leaking out of lid; unable to access the wick to use the candle. Both candles in this order were defective - very disappointing."
1,2019-12-18,"Candle arrived on time and it perfect condition.  BUT, there is no scent at all!  It just smells like wax burning.  Very disappointed in Yankee Candle!"
2,2014-04-08,"Sorely dissapointed here...bought a Mac Intosh Yankee Candle at same time and it smells great. This candle may be defective or old, but it does not smell AT ALL. I defintely expected better."
1,2020-12-05,These Yankee candles just do not give off the scent like years ago.  I returned it.  I even bought Yankee candles at Bed Bath & Beyond with the same issue.  No scent!
3,2017-10-16,Does not smell very much. Disappointed.
3,2013-01-05,This candle had a mediocre scent. not like most yankee candles. it also smoked quite a bit which is unusual for this brand
1,2021-12-28,I bought two of the large vanilla cupcake candles. I kept one and got one for a gift. You can not smell the candle scent. I have another autumn wreath candle from this seller that smells great. I was too embarrassed to give the candle as a gift. I will return.
2,2018-12-13,Candle was less than expected! Smell not as expected!
3,2016-12-07,"Itthe candle wax is full of air bubbles and I cant give it as a gift. smells great and arrived on time, but the candle wax is full of air bubbles, so I cant give it as a gift."
1,2021-10-11,Expected more of a smell like other candles they make when burned. For 20 bucks buy something different.
1,2021-02-08,The scent of this candle does not fill the room at all. I literally have to get close and sniff the candle in order to smell it. I do not recommend.
1,2021-11-20,"Every candle I have purchased from Amazon, no matter what brand have absolutely no fragrance while burning. Also, Bath and Bodyworks has become the same thing. I have wasted so much money searching for a scented candle"
3,2021-11-18,Glass was shattered when it arrived.
3,2016-07-09,"Yummy, just burns too quickly to really enjoy it for more than a day or two."
3,2017-03-09,It burned up rather quickly and often sparked a lot. An okay smell.
1,2021-11-21,Just opened the package... apparently the candle melted at some point? Don't think it happened in transit as it's basically winter outside...
1,2021-10-28,Even walmart candles will smell living room...this candle does not..wish I had read reviews.
1,2019-11-18,This candle has to be a knock off.. it has very little to no scent !! Do not buy! This is not a yankee candle .. I am a candle fanatic and this one is terrible!
3,2019-12-06,"I was so excited about this candle, but it doesn’t have a strong scent at all. Very disappointed."
3,2021-07-11,I really couldn’t smell the product would not recommend.
2,2020-02-04,"Yankee Candles are so very expensive and I buy them, on occasion, because of the strong scent they admit while burning; however, this Sparkling Cinnamon candle has almost no scent. totally bummed and almost sad it burns so long:)"
1,2017-12-01,"I'm left wondering if these are ACTUAL Yankee Candles or some kind of knockoff. The candle I received emits no scent...sorely displeased. Next time, I guess I'll only buy from the actual company. Thanks Amazon..."
1,2020-04-12,"This is a huge disappointment! I have always loved Yankee Candles, but this has no scent! I bought the French Vanilla and it doesn’t have a smell! Even when I put my nose in the candle, I can barely smell anything. Not sure if I got a fake or just a defective candle. Very disappointed!"
3,2020-05-17,Horrible! I think this is fake! You can’t smell it not even next to it! I wish I could return it! Don’t waste your money!
1,2021-03-09,This candle is a disappointment. It smells like plain wax almost like a crayon.  No scent! Maybe a knockoff of yankee? Waste of money
2,2018-12-03,Fragrance is disappointing. Does not emanate as well as other yankee candles.
1,2021-01-14,"I received a much smaller, different brand, different scent product. It was during the holidays so I did not have time to return, unfortunately."
2,2022-03-12,Unfortunately this product was completely shattered when I opened it.
1,2021-12-22,The smell was not strong like in the store
3,2020-02-15,It smelled like something was burning. It had too much smokey smell and not enough apple  or whatever scent it was supposed to have.
3,2016-11-16,"When I received this candle, the wax had melted all over the bubble wrap and outside of jar. I was not able to gift it as I had planned. Very disappointing."
1,2022-05-24,Candle has no scent did not want to mess with just left for decoration
1,2021-12-07,"I burned a Better Homes and Gardens candle right before I recieved this Yankee candle and it smelled delicious. Then I burn this candle and I can't smell it at all. I've tried setting it on a table next to my chair and I still cannot smell it. Total disappointment, wasted money."
3,2018-03-01,Love Yankee candles. My preteen as yes a candle in his room. He loves chocolate. So I thought I would get him the chocolate cake candle. The smell is way too strong for my son believe it or not. And  way too strong for me. It works but the smell is potent.  Lol
1,2020-08-04,"I bought this with 3 other candles that were fine.  It was the last one when I took the lid off, the glass broke.  I have ordered Yankee other times and this is second time the glass has not held up.  Super disappointing that I can’t get a replacement."
1,2019-09-28,"Has virtually no scent, especially while burning. I guess there’s a reason why it was on sale so cheap as a deal of the day."
3,2018-03-21,Too sweet.
1,2022-01-08,I would rather pay full price and have full smell than have a discount coupon and have no smell. I was very disappointed. I have never been disappointed with anything from Yankee Candle before
1,2022-07-16,"I'm extremely disappointed with this candle. I smelled the Spicy Pumpkin scent in a store and loved it. The candle I received does not smell nothing like the one at the store, it smells like nothing at all. Not sure if it is a fake product or what."
3,2021-06-26,Not too crazy with the scent.
2,2020-01-09,The candle in the picture is the candle I was Re-ordering but I received it and it was in a different glass. The candle didn’t last half as long as the one in the picture did.
3,2021-09-01,Casi sin olor
3,2019-09-14,Product arrived with minor damage to quality of product. Leaked to such extent the box was wet as well.
1,2022-07-28,The media could not be loaded.
4,2013-09-13,"Very good, xcept I got.the wrong scent! I ordered autumn harvest and got pumpkin pie! I'll b more careful next time!"
1,2020-10-22,"This is not a song fragrance so I was really disappointed. Additionally, it burns very unevenly - even after I followed all the steps. Would not buy again."
2,2018-12-20,I didn’t like the smell of this one
1,2021-11-21,"Waist of money, No scent at all, very disappointed as I thought Yankee candles were better than the cheap ones but they are NOT"
3,2016-09-16,"Smelled yummy, but unfortunately was broken when I got the candles"
1,2020-11-30,"This candle smells awesome if you just smell the unlit candle directly from jar.  But when its lit, you can't smell a thing in the room.  Very disappointed."
2,2019-01-06,"Smells amazing,light it nothing!"
1,2021-08-01,Melted
1,2022-08-02,No scent
1,2021-10-20,Smelled cheap n used only smelled strong wax no scented smell
1,2019-09-23,"We spent so much money as we thought yankee candles actually to have a sxent that one can smell. Excited, we used it and it did nothing in our small 900sq ft apartment!!! So disappointed"
2,2021-10-25,I can barely smell the scent. I wonder if the candle is old.
1,2022-04-03,I love Yankee candles ..or used to now it does what other candles do the back soot. That was not that case always.
4,2014-09-16,This is a long lasting great smelling candle.
1,2020-11-23,"I am so disappointed in this Yankee candle! There is almost NO SCENT in this candle! I wish I could return it, but I’ve already burned it for a couple hours."
2,2021-05-22,very small not a great value for the money
3,2018-12-24,Smell isn’t that strong
4,2015-01-19,Smelled great and arrived quickly.  Just pretty expensive for a candle that I used up in less than a month
3,2017-11-28,Smells musty.
2,2021-02-17,Smell doesn't last
1,2021-06-29,The candle isn't as good and strong as I knew the brand to be. Very disappointed
2,2018-07-22,"Had it burning for a few hours, absolutely no smell."
2,2020-03-08,"I don't quite get some of the reviews. I literally smell NOTHING from this candle, even when I put my nose right next to it. Very disappointed. I have bought other Vanilla candles and  they smelled way better than this one."
1,2020-02-03,Very dissatisfied  with this candle..little  to no scent..which is not what I'm  used to with  Yankee  candles..maybe this is just a flook but I  wont  get this one again.
1,2022-02-15,This candle had no scent whatsoever
1,2021-12-09,"I ordered vanilla cupcake. It had zero scent, burning or not. Very disappointed in Yankee candle."
3,2018-06-07,kept tunneling and the smell doesnt last.
3,2020-02-01,Good product
1,2020-10-02,"My family has been burning this scent for years and this is terrible. Doesn’t smell like Home Sweet Home and the strength of the scent is so unbelievably dull. It’s almost like they slapped the label on a crappy, weak, clearance isle candle but even those smell stronger than this. Never had a problem buying them from a store, but this is the first and last one I will be buying on Amazon. They still sell it for full price, too. What a shame"
1,2020-12-23,I’m sure it smells great but the candle never actually arrived!!!!!!! This review is more for the sender & not the candle itself.
4,2014-08-15,"Smells great, fast delivery"
1,2021-10-04,"Old, bad smell, not authentic Yankee Candle. Returned!"
1,2021-08-31,Opened pkg.and the candel was all melted and unusable!!!!!! Very dissapointed considering the money I spent!!!! So angry..dont order from this distributor....
1,2021-12-29,gave as gift. the scent is so faint no sense in lighting it. not like my previous yankee's
1,2014-05-20,"This doesn't smell like bacon.  If you think this smells like bacon, you haven't been eating bacon all these years.  This smells like beef jerky and it's almost unbearable when you just leave the lid off, let alone light it.I suppose it's for the best, I probably would have tried to eat it if it really smelled like bacon."
1,2021-11-21,This literally smells like nothing. There is no way this is a legitimate Yankee Candle.
1,2018-12-11,"I am extremely upset about this purchase. I got it for a gift and it arrived with no sticker on it to tell what kind of candle it was and the scent! It literally just came in a plain glass jar nothing on it said Yankee candle or ""apple scented "" so the person receiving the candle would have no clue what the scent was. Absolutely ridiculous."
1,2019-05-13,This is NOT the Buttercream scent of the past! It has a burnt odor and is not the pleasant sweet scent of my previous Buttercream Yankee Candle. I would not recommend this scent!
1,2019-11-16,"Yankee candles are great.. but this one? Not so much.  Its WAY too strong and overpowering ""sweet"".  Maybe its usable if you burn it for 30 minutes at a time, but any longer and it gets nauseous and sickening."
1,2020-12-02,"I CAN SMELL ME ESSENTIAL OILS JUST FINE!So no, I don’t have COVID.Waste of money.. absolutely no smell to it at all."
3,2015-04-10,The scent is FANTASTIC. Only 3 starts though because they're crazy expensive. :(
1,2020-10-20,"I've been a loyal Yankee Candle fan for over a decade, but somehow I received the wrong scent (apple) when I placed an order for a vanilla-scented candle. I'm hoping this can be resolved, as I am a huge fan of Yankee Candle's warm, sweet scent lines and I'm optimistic this was a one-time error."
2,2018-11-19,It  Doesn't have a smell to it!
4,2015-02-05,as promised
2,2019-02-13,The scent was not as strong as should have been
1,2019-07-11,I buy yankee candles and I tried the one on amazon and there was no scent when lit  Burn like 3 hours and still no scent. Was able to return them for a replacement and the replacement ones was the same  Will stick to the ones at the yankee store
1,2021-10-19,It had all melted on its side wick was nowhere to be seen
1,2021-02-03,"Absolutely no smell, I have had other yankee candles that fill up the entire room, however, the vanilla cupcake had no scent. Waste of money."
1,2021-07-17,Becareful ordering candles in the summer time! Look how this was delivered 😵
1,2022-03-31,It has been burning for 3 hours and there is a very slight scent.  There was barely a scent before it was lit.  This has a Yankee candle label but does not smell like a Yankee candle.
1,2021-09-28,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 The candle arrived melted."
1,2019-12-29,It has zero smell.  Usually the smell is delicious hence why we all buy candles.  I can’t smell it at all :( wasted $20
1,2018-10-06,I ordered Apple scented candle. Not home sweet home. And I was burning the candle and it doesn't smell like anything. Very disappointed. Wanted my Apple scented candle. Also it's almost like it's dried out. I always buy Yankee candles 🕯
4,2013-10-29,"The product itself is good, but the packaging was bad. When it arrived, it was partially melted - laid on its side - so that the wick was unseen. The candle is great overall. It's my mother's favorite scent."
1,2022-02-26,This candle has little to no scent. Do not buy! I should have listened to the other reviewers
4,2019-12-16,We love yankee candle
1,2021-05-27,They ran out of stock and filled it with any random candle. Was part of a gift for someone else.
2,2022-01-09,"No scent at all,"
1,2019-05-02,"Could hardly smell any scent. Disappointed, will not buy this scent again. Usually, have good luck with YCC but this one was a dud for sure. 4 thumbs down"
1,2021-07-27,What is deal. Candle won't stay lite.  I thought these were good candles
1,2021-10-04,"Old, bad smell, not authentic Yankee Candle. Returned!"
1,2020-12-18,This was an expensive candle.It has very little aroma...you almost have to put your nose next to it to smell the french vanilla.I sent the christmas cookie as a christmas present and I hope that one has more aroma.
2,2021-05-26,Be careful.  It’s not what you’re expecting.  It’s a really small one.
1,2021-07-13,No scent
1,2021-10-05,It came to me totally shattered sadly as I love Yankee Candles
1,2021-01-06,"When you open the candle and smell it, it’s not as strong as if you’re at a Yankee candle store. It doesn’t have any scent when it’s lit. Very disappointed"
1,2017-03-12,Came broken.
2,2015-02-09,"Really no scent, quite disappointed as I have always liked Yankee Candles.  I have bought 3 large Yankee Candles and none of them have the same scent that they used to.  I could before light the candle and it would fill my whole house with scent, not so much anymore.  I am not sure if they have changed their formula or what, but I am not impressed."
1,2022-02-19,throws a weak scent.
1,2022-03-18,The first one I got was broke.  I opted to have another one set.  That was broken too.
1,2020-03-27,I received the Buttercream candle today and it barely had a scent.☹️ I decided to swap it for another one that Amazon is sending again. I am hoping for a fragrant replacement.
1,2016-10-22,"Returned because of the lack of smell while burning.  I am so disappointed in Yankee Candle Company, I've always paid more because they always smelled stronger than less expensive candles.  This candle burned for hours and I could not smell it when I went outside then returned to the room."
1,2021-02-16,"Not sure what was wrong with this candle, the whole thing burned strange, bubbled up on top, there was moisture throughout the candle. Next time I'll just go straight to Yankee."
1,2016-11-21,"Must have been an old candle......no scent of cinnamon whatsoever.  Burned it for about 5 hours, asked all that came in the door if they could detect any cinnamon.....unanimously...a resounding NO  .  Thanks for nothing."
1,2021-10-20,Fake yankee smells nothing like a real yankee
1,2020-08-14,Second one  arrived BROKEN. I AM VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED . iS THERE A WAY TO SEND IT SO ITSO IT WOULD ARRIVE IN ONE PIECE?????
1,2022-07-02,I bought three candles and the smell is non-existent when burning. Very disappointed
3,2017-01-06,"It must've melted during shipping or in the factory because it came with some melted candle all around the jar, looking like blood on a slaughtered animal, and staining my hands. I wouldn't have minded that much but it's definitely not a good thing if using this as a gift."
1,2021-01-04,"Beautiful candle design, very disappointed with the scent.  Expected to enjoy a spiced. Pumpkin aroma.  This candle is lacking in any aroma.  Very pretty to look at, but does not deliver on the scent.  Very disappointed ☹️"
1,2020-09-20,Very disappointed.  I could barely tell there was even a smell to the candle.  I will not purchase this brand again.  One star.
1,2021-12-29,I have bought these years before through a private seller and there was a log lasting sent but these that I bought thru Amazon have no sent what so ever unless you put your nose into the jar otherwise none ! would never buy again to bad I could'nt get a refund for the ones I bought!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,2022-07-31,This was supposed to be a gift.
3,2019-12-26,Doesn't smell so good
1,2019-11-21,"I bought 4 candles because they were the special of the day. I have burned 2 out of 4 and you CANNOT smell the scent. I think they were old candles and that is why they were on sale, I am So very disappointed!! I love a great smelling candle but will never buy yankee candle again."
1,2021-12-14,This did not smell like a normally Yankee candle. It smells old and not very strong. Throw  it away.
1,2020-12-07,This candle smells great but unfortunately it arrived already used. So obvious when I opened the candle and the wick had clearly been burned and for quite a while judging from the amount of candle gone. Cannot reccomend.
2,2021-04-12,The smell is very faint more for a small space like a bathroom not a main room .
1,2020-09-25,Burned 2 of these for 4 hrs and could not smell a thing. Walked in and out from outside and neither myself nor my husband could smell a thing. What a waste of money!!!
1,2022-01-09,Was excited to find a Yankee candle at a great price but DISAPPOINTED that there was no scent with burning.
1,2020-04-25,"I have been using Yankee Candles for years.  This was the first time I purchased one from Amazon, and the first time I have ever written a negative review.  This candle has absolutely no scent.  I am very disappointed."
4,2016-06-28,Lovely spicy smell. Good for thanksgiving/Christmas period
3,2020-01-02,Very little scent
2,2014-03-31,"This candle smells great but it does not fill a room. If you need to noticeably smell the fragrance, this is not the candle for you."
3,2015-01-19,"Too strong a smell for me, but good quality candle."
1,2017-11-25,Something is different. There is almost no scent in this candle. Even if you stick your nose in the jar it is so light that you can't really tell what the scent is. I have used this before and this must be a bad batch. Sent back.
4,2015-11-02,It smells nice but not as potent as some others. Would still buy again.
2,2021-03-13,"Disappointed by the bubbles in the wax, it made the candle look like it had a defect."
3,2015-10-19,Don't know why but the flair on this candle is extremely weak.  Have to be right next to it to smell it.
1,2019-12-13,"I usually don’t leave bad reviews, but this candle needs to be taken down and never sold again. These people need to refund everybody their $17 they threw away on this candle. Total piece of crap. Don’t buy don’t buy don’t buy!!!"
1,2014-08-09,Completely agree with the others.  Beggin' strips meets liquid smoke.  There are better bacon candles out there.
1,2019-05-12,"Been buying Yankee candle for years. Don’t know if this old or what, but virtually no scent."
1,2022-05-13,This candle was partially melted so I couldn’t light it because I couldn’t get the wick exposed! Another time the jar was broken! I really love this scent too! Very disappointed!
2,2020-01-14,They were labeled as Yankee candles but there was little to no scent.  I assume now that they were very old.
1,2021-12-19,Took out to gift and when I opened it I noticed it was melted. I am very sure that it came this way bc it went straight into my garage when it was delivered and there is no heat out there. Totally ticked
1,2020-02-27,Unfortunately Yankee Candle quality is poor at this point.  I purchased a large jar candle that burns from the center down leaving most of the wax on the sides.  I used to love their candles but will no longer be purchasing from them unless of until the quality improves
1,2019-11-05,The scent is not as strong as the other Yankee Candles I’ve bought. Even the ones I got from TJMAXX as $12.99 are better than this! Extremely disappointing!
1,2021-10-19,Smell made me sick i threw it away after trying it a second time. Yuck
1,2021-01-20,This candle STINKS. It smells like a cheap vanilla scented car air freshener. Do not recommend.
1,2021-07-02,No smell at all. Lit candle and also tried putting it on a melting plate. Nothing. Waste of money. This can’t be the real thing
1,2020-05-27,I’ve lived these in the past but the most recent one does not have a strong scent at all. I’m ot sure what’s changed but I am super disappointed.
2,2020-05-24,Unfortunately the candle glass was cracked upon me opening the box and chunks of glass fell out once I pulled it out. Not able to gift.
1,2020-10-24,Wish I had read the reviews but thought you could trust Yankee Candle. I agree 100%. Can’t smell it after it burning 2 hours.  Don’t buy!!!!
4,2016-09-28,Favorite scent.
1,2019-10-02,Yankee scents are to weak.. can hardly smell them ..
1,2019-12-06,Very little scent unless you put your nose directly over the candle.  Last year's leftovers!
1,2021-10-22,Nice scent but pumpkin spice candle damaged not giftsble
5,2014-11-10,Purchased this as a christmas gift for one of my sons.  I know he is going to love it!
1,2021-12-16,There was no smell
1,2021-05-29,The scent is not as strong as it should be. It says it’s made in the Czech Repulic so I’m not sure it’s a real Yankee. The Yankees I bought at the store are made in the USA and have a much stronger scent.
1,2018-12-21,Very disappointed with this product. It burnt so uneven pretty much straight down the wick and left all the wax along it’s side of the jar. Yankee candle is supposed to be the best and at $20.00 a piece as I said very disappointed!
1,2021-08-18,"Burn straight down the side instead of the center, and barely any scent"
1,2020-01-21,I was hoping this would make my office smell like fall...but it had very little scent :(.
1,2021-12-19,I wanted the candle to smell like cake but had no scent. Do not buy
1,2020-06-01,"Scam? Possibly! Received pkg today...was looking forward to it but Apparently some1 got AHOLD of and lit the wick before I Could!?!!Seriously upset! Also, ordered Warm Vanilla and I received French Vanilla! Not SURE Who to blame but its coming from Amazon Warehouse, So..make your own judgment!SMHNOT a HAPPY CAMPER."
1,2020-04-16,"I’ve had this candle burning for 2 hours, and I still can’t smell it. No scent at all. Way too expensive for a candle that you can’t even smell! Will me ever buy again."
1,2022-03-09,Beautiful color but no scent. Very disappointed. Not worth the money.
1,2017-09-22,Received it broken! Seriously disappointed because iv been looking forwards to this candle and it finally gets here and I don't even open the bubble wrap before I knotice there's shards of glass broken off the top and who knows where
1,2021-08-13,I purchased a woodwick candle previously and loved it so I decided to splurge on a new one. It has absolutely no scent. You can burn it for hours and you don't even smell the wax. It also does not burn evenly like the previous Yankee candle I had.
1,2018-02-14,scent too sweet and gives us all headaches...not going to burn this one just leave it out and open
1,2021-10-26,This candle has absolutely NO scent. So  disappointing.
3,2019-09-23,The order came to me with 1 of the 3 jars broken !  This same problem occurred when my son ordered me 3 at Christmas.What seems to be the problem?
1,2021-10-21,Delivered broken.
1,2020-11-25,I’ve always loved Yankee candles and this is the first candle that I’ve had a problem with. This candle arrived broken.
1,2020-10-18,"The Pumpkin Spice candle can only be smelled if you hold it a couple inches from your face (and it just smells vaguely cinnamon-y, not pumpkin spice). If you’re sitting in a room with it, even a small room, zero smell. I’ve loved other Yankee Candles (e.g. Christmas Morning) but this one sucks."
1,2019-11-24,"I ordered the vanilla cupcake candle for my boyfriend’s mom and since it was a gift you would expect it to be perfect.. it came with some weird stain of the wax on the glass, so I asked for a new one to be sent and the new one had it too.. if your ordering for a gift don’t order from here"
2,2021-10-19,No fragrance.  Now I know why they were marked down. 👎
1,2021-09-10,Not sure if these candles just didn’t pass a Quality inspection or something for yankee candle but the scent is pretty much non-existent!
1,2022-08-08,I purchased the cupcake scent previously and it was wonderful. I then ordered the same again and there is zero scent! Will not purchase this again. Apparently there is no quality control....
1,2021-11-14,This is absolutely ridiculous!!! There should be no reason that this candle was sent to me like this!!! Now I could return it for an Amazon credit or I can put the money towards something else that it offers but nothing I want and I still have to pay the difference! Not happy at all
1,2021-11-04,No scent at all. Candle has burned for  3 hrs and I can not smell anything. Living in regret. Save your money do not purchase this!
1,2020-06-24,I have smelled this candle before and that’s why I wanted it... the candle I have has no smell !!! I’m so disappointed!
1,2020-05-27,Umm is this a candle? The smell is just not strong enough... I was supper disappointed. When you walked in the room u smelt nothing... I am assuming this is for hyper sensitive smellers.
3,2019-11-23,I should have listened to reviews...mine too lost scent after being lit 4 times.
2,2021-10-15,No scent
1,2019-01-17,They don’t smell! I’ve purchased this brand and candle set for years. These must be old stock that lost their scent. Don’t waste your money!
2,2017-07-19,NO SCENT whatsoever.  Waste of money.  Returned.
1,2020-10-15,I’m very disappointed that the scent of the candle is sooooo faint.
3,2015-12-09,Not as fragrant as I thought.
1,2021-10-09,I have always loved yankee candles and the vanilla cupcake has been my favorite candle for 20 yrs. The candle I received however had no smell at all. Think like a tee light candle! Nothing. I’m not sure when yankee candle changed their formula but It’s sad 😞
1,2016-09-08,I have bought the Harvest large jar candle for many years. I have a small living room and the scent filled it beautifully. I am so disappointed with the one I just received. No scent at all !! I'll keep it. It costs too much to return. I should have listened to other reviews that also found it scent less.
1,2020-09-12,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
        
    
    
 The wick stopped working after only a few burns. It won't light anymore."
1,2021-11-12,Wasn't wrapped as I ordered it.
1,2018-08-20,"This is the third Yankee candle in the last month I have bought that i have had a issue with. I am starting to wonder if these are knock offs. This one and the buttercream have no smell what so ever, not sure again what's going on as all my others have been perfect from Amazon."
1,2021-10-12,"I don’t usually write negative reviews ever, but the candle was expensive and almost no fragrance. All of my other candles you can actually smell. I’m wondering if I received a dud."
2,2019-01-30,Smells amazing. Cheap price for great product
1,2019-01-03,So far been lit for over two hrs And we cant smell any scent. Way to mild. If all you want a candle for is light its great. If you want a scent it  is not so good.
2,2021-10-21,There is no scent at all.
2,2018-04-16,not a lot of sent in this candle
1,2021-11-14,"came with a mold on it!!! wtf?!?!! on 4 different candles!If i'm burning the candle while having mold on it, It means I need to breath itThis is so upsetting!! I will ask for a refund but for now I would'nt recommend buing for sure!"
1,2022-01-29,"I'm very disappointed.  I've burned this candle 3-4 hours a day for 3 days and you can't smell the scent.  Not sure if I can return it after burning it, but I'm going to try.  Really wanted the smell of vanilla to fill the room."
1,2021-10-15,when i received the pumpkin candles they were melted and all out of shape in the jar.  i think they had to be like this when they were sent because i also received another apple scented candle in the same shipment and it was perfectly fine.
2,2015-08-16,For what you charge for Yankee candles there should be more scented oil in it.  You can barely smell it.
3,2014-10-24,just not impressed with the quality of yankee candles anymore....
1,2021-01-31,I love yankee candies but this one was a disappointment. It had no scent
1,2021-09-19,The candle doesn’t not smell when lit
1,2021-03-04,No scent returned in a few days. I tried it several times
1,2020-08-21,Broken
1,2019-11-10,"Yankee candle used to be the best, now no better than any cheap candles, no scent at all."
3,2020-03-22,The smell was very limited.  It barely even cover a small room.
1,2020-12-11,For some reason these candles have no scent whatsoever.  I have had this issue with Yankee Candles before and thought it was a one time issue.  These are expensive items.  I would return but have burned some of both jars I bought to see if both were defective.  I won’t be buying Yankee Candles again.
1,2022-07-11,I will just burn them but put them up high so no one gets injured. Disappointed was going to use them as gifts!!
1,2021-03-05,There is absolutely no scent from this candle. A complete waste of money.
2,2017-09-01,Very little smell
3,2015-03-09,Smell was very weak. Even in small room. It was minus four degrees the day I received it and it does state on the bottom of the jar the ideal temp. for the candle....I don't think it was meant for -4 degree. I will try again as I really like Yankee Candles. (The smell was nice....)
1,2021-06-24,The box was heavily saturated with a vanilla scent and oily. It seems like the candle melted and leaked in the box. There's no wick and the top of the candle was broke. Plus it had melted to one side.
1,2020-05-02,Spent $20 on a candle that gives off no scent. I have to hold it up to my face to smell the alleged 'vanilla' scent. I'll contact seller of this 'Yanke Candle' and write an update.
1,2021-08-04,No scent in the candle. At. All.
1,2019-07-19,Horrible! Arrived melted! AGAIN for the 2nd time. Surprised that a company like yankee would allow this twice.
1,2021-11-04,Absolutely no scent. Burnt is down hoping for scent. I hesitate ordering another.
2,2017-04-22,Just don't like the fragrance.......just my taste.
2,2014-08-17,"Very disappointed in the fragrance of these candles.  When I received them 1 was broken, the glass shattered.  Tried to save the candle itself but there is no smell at all.  Not sure if these were old but would never reorder."
1,2020-03-10,I enjoyed Yankee Candles so much but not sure what has happened to their “recipe” for their scented candles. The last two I purchased had no scent. The old candles smelled so good till the bottom of the jar. These new candles are terrible. :(
1,2020-01-26,Expensive and they kept going out. Will not buy again.
1,2018-12-12,"I bought two candles and neither one has detectable scent. Very disappointed. I usually really  like Yankee Candles above the rest. Candles did seem to be ""frozen"". Maybe  contributed to the problem..😞😞😞"
1,2020-01-20,Overpriced crap. I will never buy another yankee candle.
1,2020-01-25,Very disappointed in yankee candles.  only burned this a short time and it wont burn except in the center.. waste of money on this one.
1,2021-05-05,Virtually no scent when burning.  Not happy
1,2020-11-16,So disappointed!  Yankee candles used to smell up your whole room. Can barely smell this candle.
4,2012-12-30,Yankkee candles are always a great treat. They are long lasting and their scent is true to their label. Great value too.
1,2021-12-30,Very upset. I’ve never had a yankee candle not smell amazing. I purchased scents I knew I liked. Neither candle smelt like anything unless you were right next to it
1,2020-05-04,This candle has NO scent. It is NOT a normal yankee candle and I’m so sad. Can’t leave the house due to COVID and now I can’t even have a fresh scent.I’m very disappointed.
3,2018-04-20,"Great buy, not bad of a price and wonderful smell. 👍"
1,2020-05-13,"I got the large salted caramel candle because of the good reviews but this is massively underwhelming. For $20 and the yankee candle name I thought I was going to get a really good candle but this candle can’t even fill up a small room. I have $4 candles from Walmart that fill my whole apartment, save your money and get a mainstays candle from Walmart."
2,2016-04-24,I love Yankee candles.....but this one smelled a bit odd.
1,2022-06-22,I generally like all the Yankee Candle scents.  Spiced Pumpkin was a fail.  Can’t recommend.
1,2021-08-08,No throw whatsoever. Disappointed.
1,2020-12-20,This has absolutely no scent and I’m extremely upset after spending so much on this candle.
1,2020-01-27,Box was damaged and had a notice outside the box saying box was damaged.  Candle's glass container was broken into small pieces.
4,2019-01-27,Like price
1,2020-12-25,This candle has no smell doesn't burn even after 4 hours of burning. And for some reason it's separated. Would not recommend to buy or to gift to someone.
1,2020-11-29,Scent lasted one day and is gone.  I would expect more from a Yankee candle.
1,2021-04-05,The smell didn't smell like Chocolate at all.
1,2021-10-09,"Bad bad,,,BAD"
1,2020-12-10,It just smell like spiced pumpkin. Seems as though the wrong label may have been placed on it. Dissatisfied.
2,2020-10-22,"Dislike scent,  makes my family nauseous"
2,2020-10-18,This Yankee Candle gives off no scent AT ALL. Very disappointing.
2,2019-12-04,The scent is not strong enough (hint of a scent)and The  scentdecreas’s  in a few weeks . Price exceeds the quality.
1,2020-06-10,Doesn’t even smell- don’t bother. I figured I would be able to get this candle without worrying if it would smell cause vanilla candles are always really strong but this one doesn’t at all. I would highly suggest the wood wick vanilla bean candle it smells amazingly and wood wicks are always a plus
2,2018-04-12,Not a lot of fragrance
1,2020-12-06,Candle had bubbles in it and had almost no smell. Very disappointed. Horrible gone in 2-3 days. It is fake
4,2018-03-03,"I love this candle it lasts for a long time and smells up my whole house. It smells great but the reason why I gave it 4 and not 5 is because it doesnt smell like chocolate cake to me atleast. I think if it had a tiny bit more of a vanilla note to it, that would give it a kore cakey smell. But it does smell like chocolate. My son asked me if I had brownies in the oven first night I burned it lol. To me it smells like the tootsie roll candy if you ever had that?? But overall great candle."
1,2019-12-01,"I've purchased lots of Yankee candles over the years, but this one is a DUD.  It has NO SCENT at all.  It's just a ball of wax in a jar . . . sooooo disappointed!!"
1,2021-12-07,"Unfortunately, there's very minimal smell coming from the candle. Very disappointed."
2,2018-12-31,Did not burn well. Wax flooded out the wick half way down candle. Left large ring of unburned candle around glass. Not much cinnamon scent.  Very disappointed being a long time yankee candle buyer.
1,2021-10-11,What a disappointment. I’ve been purchasing Yankee candles for years.  The quality is no longer what it used to be . I always bought these for gifts as well as for myself. Never again.
2,2013-01-12,scent pretty weak for price.  bought 4 slightly smaller jar candles at walmart with similar scent for same price.  would not buy again
1,2020-06-05,No smell at all
3,2015-02-26,"nice candle, scent could be stronger"
1,2022-03-05,"So I'm not unhappy with the scent I got, it's just something else entirely from what I ordered and was mislabeled as such"
2,2018-09-02,"Smells great, but arrived melting and with wax all over outside of jar"
1,2019-08-19,Candle arrived broken in the box with glass shards everywhere. Product unusable.
1,2020-12-07,Too expensive for the Fragrance. Very little X fragrance
3,2017-10-25,"The smell from the candle isn't as strong as I was expecting but its there and its pleasant. You only notice the smell when the candle has been lit and you leave the room and come back, but then you will quickly become used to the smell and will not notice it as you are sitting in the room. And that's kind of disappointing considering the premium price tag on this brand of candle."
1,2020-01-29,Appeared to be old.  No scent when lit.  Would not buy again
1,2022-08-04,The media could not be loaded.
5,2014-11-08,I love this scent!  Arrived on time and in tack... Thank you :)
1,2022-03-07,Can barely smell this candle
1,2021-11-12,The candle had melted and then hardened so that the wax covered the wick. It’s totally unusable. For some reason it’s not returnable.
2,2020-11-21,Hardly any scent at all and burned super quickly. For reference I purchased the large candle.
1,2020-10-23,"This is not a real yankee candle. I assumedThe reviews were wrong but they weren’t. It’s a very cheap, gross version of a yankee candle. Don’t buy."
1,2020-05-07,"The candle came in completely broke. Glass all over the box. It came from the yankee candle but it was poorly packaged. If I could give it zero stars I definitely would, never buying again."
1,2019-11-16,There us hardly any scent. I bought a glade candle at walmart for $6 that is great. Wouldn't recomnend if you want the smell
1,2022-01-14,This was melted out of the jar and out of the jar was not returnable due to amizon not allowing
2,2017-11-14,very little scent
1,2021-06-05,When lit doesn't smell
1,2020-01-15,"The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
 I melted it in a pan on the stove so I really can’t return it but today when I put it on the stove I was thinking this was a waste of money because it just burn down the middle don’t know if you can refund or not"
1,2019-03-09,"The smell was great, but the shape of the glass put a black film (smoke) around the top of the jar--not to pretty to look at!"
3,2018-01-25,not crazy about the smell
1,2021-01-14,"Buyer beware.. All of the discounted Yankee candles I have purchased so far have been either broken,no smell to them, or something wrong with them. They are discounted for a reaaon"
1,2020-10-04,I just got the box and the candle is broken... so disappointed!
1,2022-03-25,"No es original,  not original"
2,2020-12-23,I think these were rejects. I went to pick one up and the jar shattered in my hand.
1,2021-08-31,Do not waste your money buying this! I tried to give it a chance but there is literally no smell. It’s extremely faint like you have to sniff a lot to smell when it’s not burning. Burned it for 2 hours and there was still no smell. This probably isn’t even a real yankee candle.
3,2019-12-26,The scent was cinnamon not by favorite at all
2,2018-03-26,This scent is very strong and not very enjoyable
