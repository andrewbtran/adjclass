## Importing and Exporting data

## CSV files

Comma separated files are the most common way to save spreadsheets that doesn't require a paid program from Microsoft to open.

### What a csv file looks like

CSV file names end with a **.csv**

### What a csv file looks like on the inside

This explains the values separated with commas part of the file name.

![](images/csv2.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

## Importing CSV files

- Importing CSV is part of base R, no package needed
- But we're going to use a package anyway, **readr**

## Two ways to get data

* If you have the URL address
    * If the csv file exists on the internet, you don’t have to download it to your local machine and then import it, you can import it to R directly from the web using the link
* If you have the file on your computer

## Get the URL



If you have the link to a CSV file, right click [the link](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Admissions-to-DMHAS-Addiction-Treatment-by-Town-Ye/iyru-82zq/data) of the data and click **Copy Link Address**. This data set can be found on the [Connecticut Open Data Portal](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Admissions-to-DMHAS-Addiction-Treatment-by-Town-Ye/iyru-82zq/).

![](images/rightclick.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

## read.csv()

The Base R function to import a CSV file is `read.csv()`. Just put the URL address in quotation marks and add the `stringsAsFactors=F` (In this code we're using the function `head()`-- this returns 6 rows by default, but we want to look at 10, so we’ll specify that when we call the function head(data, 10))

```{r segment1}
df_csv <- read.csv("https://data.ct.gov/api/views/iyru-82zq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", stringsAsFactors=F)
head(df_csv, 10)
```


## The other way to import the data: Download it

When you right click on the link, instead of clicking **Copy Link Address**-- this time, click **Save Link As...**

![](images/downloading.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

Save to your working directory.

After saving to the directory, click on the circle arrow on the right to refresh the files to make sure it's there.

![](images/directory.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

## Recall: How to change directories in RStudio

Either by typing `setwd("/directory/where/you/want")` or by clicking in the menu up top **Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory...**

![](images/setwd.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

## Importing local csv data

Just like before, except instead of the URL, it's the name of the file.

**Note:** This will only work if the working directory is set to where the csv file is.

```{r segment2}
df_csv <- read.csv("data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
```


## stringsAsFactors=F

Why? 

Blame statisticians.

Back when R was created the users weren't using it as we use it now, with all these different strings.

**What happens when you don't use `stringsAsFactors=F`**

```{r segment3b}
df_csv <- read.csv("data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv")
str(df_csv)
```



## Using read_csv() from the readr package

**readr** is a package that read rectangular data quickly and assumes characters are strings and not factors by default.

```{r segment4}
## If you don't have readr installed yet, uncomment and run the line below
#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
df_csv <- read_csv("data/Admissions_to_DMHAS_Addiction_Treatment_by_Town__Year__and_Month.csv")
```

As you can see, the `read_csv()` function interpreted the **MonthYear** and **Town** columns as characters and not as Factors as `read.csv()` did.

## Exporting CSV files

When you're done analyzing or transforming your data, you can save your dataframe as a CSV file with `write_csv()` from the **readr** package.

```{r export1, eval=F}
# Pass the write_csv() function the name of the dataframe and what you want to call the file
write_csv(df_csv, "transformed_data.csv")
```

The file will save to your working directory, but you can specify sub directories with the function.

```{r export2, eval=F}
# Pass the write_csv() function the name of the dataframe and what you want to call the file
write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv")
```

## Exporting data frames with `NA` 

Weird quirk alert: Exported files will include `NA`s so to replace them, pass the variable `na="whatever"`. 

```{r export3, eval=F}
# This replaces the NAs with blanks
write_csv(df_csv, "data/transformed_data.csv", na="")
```

## Excel files

Excel spreadsheets are unique in that they can contain multiple spreadsheets as a workbook.

## What an Excel file looks like

Excel file names end with a **.xls** or **.xlsx**

![](images/excel1.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

## What an Excel file looks like on the inside

Weird, right? Definitely difficult to parse.

![](images/excel2.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

What I do sometimes (often) is save a sheet from Excel as a .csv file.

That's a short cut. But if you want to be transparent and really deal with the raw data then:

## Importing Excel files
- Importing Excel is complicated, **readxl package** is needed
- There are more other packages that handle Excel files and can build extra sheets, but we won't be needing them for this instance

## Importing Excel files

First, install the `readxl` package if you have not yet done so. 

That will have `readxl` as part of the group of packages.

```{r segment3a}
## If you don't have readxl installed, uncomment the line below and run it 
#install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

Unlike a csv, you can't just copy and paste the URL for an Excel sheet. 

You gotta download the file first.

Right click the link of the [Excel data link](http://www.ct.gov/ocme/cwp/view.asp?a=2165&Q=295128&ocmeNav=|) and click **Save File As...**

![](images/saveexcel.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

## read_excel()

Excel spreadsheets have multiple sheets and it's best to explore what it looks like in Excel first because `read_excel()` requires specific sheets to be referred to when importing.

Give it a shot with the first sheet.

```
df_xl <- read_excel("data/StatisticsSummary.xls", sheet=1)
```

Check it

```
View(df_xl)
```

![](images/excel_imported.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}


**This isn't right**. 

The problem with Excel files is that people love to format it in ways that make it look nice in Excel but makes no sense in R.

## read_excel() again


But this time we'll add `skip=2` so it skips the first rows when bringing in the data.

```{r skip}
df_xl <- read_excel("data/StatisticsSummary.xls", sheet=1, skip=2)
```

Much better

```
View(df_xl)
```

![](images/excel_imported2.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

*Notice that the column names are preserved with spaces and symbols.*



```{r df_xl}
# the colnames() function lists the column names of the dataframe
colnames(df_xl)
```

So how would one refer to the data in the columns with spaces

If we did it like normal with the `$` to pull the column we'd try

```{r df_xl_col_fail, error=T}
head(df_xl$Other Cases)
```

See, spaces won't work. This is how to deal with columns with spaces-- add the back tick next to the 1 button on your keyboard.

```{r df_xl_col_pass, error=T}
head(df_xl$`Other Cases`)
```

It's some extra finger work that you might be okay with if it was in a limited basis.

However, in anticipation of the work we're going to be doing, we should go ahead and simplify the column names so there are no characters or spaces. Here's how

## Cleaning (part 1)

We'll use the `make.names()` function on the column names. This function makes syntactically valid names out of character vectors (as in in strips out the spaces and replaces them with periods)

```{r next}
colnames(df_xl) <- make.names(colnames(df_xl))
```

Check it

```
View(df_xl)
```

![](images/makenames.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

```{r new_colnames}
colnames(df_xl)
```

Alright, that's a bit better. 

Still, there's some oddness in the names but that's because enters were replaced with periods.

Check out the first column: `Fiscal.Year......7.1.6.30`

Let's change that so it's easier to type later on.

## Change the name of a single column

I'll show you how to do it in Base R and using the dplyr package

Copy `Fiscal.Year......7.1.6.30` and paste it into 
`colnames(dataframe_name)[colnames(dataframe_name) == 'ColumnNameToBeChanged'] <- 'NewColumnName'

```{r colrename, eval=F}
# Don't run this, I just want to show you the process
colnames(df_xl)[colnames(df_xl) == 'Fiscal.Year......7.1.6.30'] <- 'Year'
```

Here's how to do it with dplyr: By using the `rename()` function.

```{r colrename2}
## If you don't have dplyr installed yet, uncomment the line below and run it
# install.packages("dplyr")

library(dplyr)
df_xl <- rename(df_xl, Year=Fiscal.Year......7.1.6.30)
```

It's slightly different-- there are less parentheses and brackets and equal signs.

And you don't need to add quotation marks.

Check it

```{r colnames_again}
colnames(df_xl)
```

Fix the other names if you want. I'm going to leave them as is for now.


## Is the df_xl sheet clean enough to work with?

Scroll down to the bottom of the data.

![](/images/nas.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}


Not clean yet. There are a bunch of `NA`s. 

That might give us some issues later on so let's take care of it now.

## Eliminating NAs

Easiest way to get rid of NAs is to subset or filter out the `NA`s based on one column.

Let's use the `Year` column.

There are two ways: `subset()` or `filter()`

1. Base R
```{r base}
df_xl <- subset(df_xl, !is.na(Year))
```

2. dplyr
```{r dplyr}
## If you don't have dplyr installed yet, uncomment the line below and run it
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
df_xl <- filter(df_xl, !is.na(Year))
```

What's the difference? dplyr is part of the tidyverse suite of packages that we'll be getting into later on in the course. Go ahead and use that.

## Check it

![](images/no.nas.png?classes=shadow){width=100%}

No `NAs` at the bottom.

It took a few lines of code but the data has been cleaned up enough to analyze or visualize with.

## Exporting to Excel

It's preferable to save data frames as CSVs because it's more open and doesn't require a paid program for others to open.

But if you must, there are some decent walkthroughs:

* [Using the xlsx package](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/writing-data-from-r-to-excel-files-xls-xlsx)
* [Reading and importing Excel files into R](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-tutorial-read-excel-into-r)
